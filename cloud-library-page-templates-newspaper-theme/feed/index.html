Hi Martin,

Thank you for reaching out to us, and for the kind words. Sure! Only the Admin and Editor can edit the Cloud Templates, but the other users (authors or contributors) can only see the templates, without the possibility of actually modifying and saving any of them. Have a lovely 2021 :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there,
is it possible to hide the Cloud Templates from the roles editors/authors, so that they can&#039;t manipulate the website but focus on writing their articles?
Thanks a lot for your work!]]></description>

Hi,

I feel sorry if you are facing some problems with our theme! Please note that all the footer templates cannot be edited itself but only if you will edit the entire page/homepage. Unfortunately, this account is not assigned to our support forum and that&#039;s why, if you need more technical assistance, you have to open a new support ticket at our support forum from here -&gt; https://forum.tagdiv.com/forum/newspaper/ where you need to provide more details about your problem and we are ready to help you.

All the best!]]></description>

Hi,

A cloud footer template can be set in the theme panel https://prnt.sc/thk7zt There you can choose from your available footer templates, either imported or created by you using a blank cloud footer template. If there is a problem in your case, we could take a look. You can send us an email at contact@tagdiv.com and provide a link to the website, admin login, and the license key. We will try to help.

Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s up with the TD composer and woocommerce? When can we start using the td composer to start building custom woocommerce pages and woocommerce single product pages? This is way long over due and should of been implemented a long time ago. We shouldn&#039;t have to use another third party plugin to accomplish creating stores with the newspaper theme. This is a much expected request and feature that I seen in the newspaper forums. This should be top priority. Please let&#039;s see this happen in the near future. We love the td composer but it lacks this feature. Thank you!]]></description>

Thank you for being our awesome customer. When a new update will be available for the Newsmag theme, you&#039;ll be notified. However, please note that Newsmag is similar to Newspaper, but it is quite different in terms of functionalities and customization so the updates are also distinct. If you need any help, please let us know via forum or by email. We&#039;re always ready to help! Thank you for understanding. Have an awesome day!]]></description>

Hi! Thank you for your honest feedback. Usually, and as a good practice, on the mobile pages there are less elements than on the desktop version. This functionality makes the website smoother on the mobile devices so your audience has a better user experience when navigating through your site. However, you can include as many elements onto the mobile pages as you want, and then, optimize the pages to get a higher score in Google Page Insights reports. Also, the usage of advertisements may slow down the website. As the Blog is not assigned to the Customer Support Department, please let us know via forum or by email if you need any technical help with your theme. Weâ€™re ready to assist you! Thank you for understanding.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, 

I see you&#039;re faking the speed on Google Page Speed, you&#039;ve removed most of all the elements on mobile view, that&#039;s why you get the nice scores on mobile. Can you put all elements showing on the desktop to showing on mobile?
Also, have you tried to embed Google Adsense and Google Analytics? It becomes very slow when you do use it. Unfortunately, this is a useless tool.]]></description>

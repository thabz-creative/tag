Hi John, 

Thank you for using our theme to build your website. Unfortunately, that functionality is not possible on pages the way it is on posts. The single page content brings on the front the content written in the WordPress posts section, whereas in pages you drag and drop the elements directly from the tagDiv Composer list. If you need assistance, please don&#039;t hesitate to always contact our skilled customer support team, as this area is not assigned to the Customer Support Department. You can either open a new topic in the forum.tagdiv.com or send us an email at contact@tagdiv.com. Thank you for understanding!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi guys, I&#039;ve been working with Newspaper theme recently and is great, I could edit my homepage, header, footer (it was a bit tricky at the beginning) even the structure of a single post page which has the single post content, so it works good.

The problem is when I try to edit a simple page, I can&#039;t find an option to add &quot;single page content&quot; as in the post, so I can&#039;t change the structure of pages, any ideas? I&#039;ve looked everywhere]]></description>

Hi Giovanni,

Thank you for reaching out to us. One possibility would be to add borders between your columns to acquire a vertical line. If you need any help with this, please let us know either by forum or via email, as the Blog area is not assigned to the Customer Support Department. Thank you for understanding! Have a lovely day ahead :)]]></description>

Hi,

We could take a look and try to help. If there are problems with the cache you are using, they are most likely caused by the settings in the cache. Perhaps some of them have to be disabled, or configured differently. So if there are problems and you want us to check, please send us an email at contact@tagdiv.com and provide a link to the website, admin login, and details about the problems that are happening on the website due to the cache. 

Thank you!]]></description>

Hi,

Thank you for your message! Please not that our theme can be used in full width mode but only if you will adjust the width for each ROW, like this -&gt; https://www.screencast.com/t/5ngm9Bfg Unfortunately, this account is not assigned to our support forum and that&#039;s why, if you need more technical assistance, you have to open a new support ticket at our support forum from here -&gt; https://forum.tagdiv.com/forum/newspaper/ where you need to provide more details about your problem and we are ready to help you.

All the best!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hello team newspaperx,

first of all a big congratulations for the next level of newspaperx, i am a big fan of this theme and all the demos, i have previously used this theme but unfortunately i have to leave because the theme is not comfortable with WP Rocket, i am also a huge big fan of WP Rocket.
My Question is:-
1. When We Will Get The Option Of Increasing/Decreasing The Width Option(I DON&#039;T WANT TO MENTION ANY THEME NAME HERE. Like few themes have on Google)
2. When Newspaper Will Test WP Rocket on Their Theme???]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Blue Host is okay for beginners or blogs that have little traffic, but once your site&#039;s traffic takes off you are at their mercy due to the shared servers they offer.  One day I woke up to find they had disabled my account and all sites, and they basically held me hostage until I agreed to upgrade to a VPS that I would have to also manage. Luckily, Blue Host offers a 30-day satisfaction guarantee on their new orders and that allowed me to regain access to my files which I promptly moved to Liquid Web who specializes in WordPress hosting. I still have a Blue Host account for a couple of tiny, no traffic sites because of their price points, but if you are serious about your Wordpress hosting you should steer clear from these guys.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a horrible experience with Bluehost on a VPS. If you don&#039;t have a busy site, you won&#039;t know how poor their performance is, but you will pay a lot for little, even if you don&#039;t run into the limits I did. You can get far better performance for less elsewhere. Bluehost makes claims about handling millions of visitors per month, but they choked with 300 users on simultaneously. If you are on a host that can&#039;t handle 1,500 people on your WordPress site simultaneously and are paying over $10 a month, you have the wrong webhost.]]></description>

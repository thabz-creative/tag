Hi, 

Thank you for reaching out to us. If you want to have the same page, you need to not use the mobile theme. If you need assistance, please open a new topic in the forum or send us an email, as the Blog area is not assigned to the Customer Support Department. Thank you for understanding!]]></description>

Hi, 

Thank you for reaching out. The mobile pages are customizable, while when using the Mobile Theme and the AMP functionality the pages are not editable. The AMP issue you mentioned is not associated with the Newspaper theme nor its functionality. You need to add images of a larger size, as it seems you are using pictures that are below the recommended size. Please note that if you need technical help, the blog area is not assigned to the Customer Support Department. If you would like to reach our support team, please open a new topic in the forum or send us an email. We&#039;re always ready to help! Thank you for understanding.]]></description>

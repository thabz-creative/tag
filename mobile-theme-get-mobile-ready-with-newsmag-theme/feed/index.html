Hi,

Make sure that you are using the WP Super Cache plugin and also, it is properly set up according to our guide from here -&gt; https://forum.tagdiv.com/cache-plugin-install-and-configure/ After that, ensure that you have setup the Mobile theme + AMP according to our guide from here -&gt; https://forum.tagdiv.com/tagdiv-amp-plugin-tutorial/ Unfortunately, this account is not assigned to our support forum and that&#039;s why, if you need more technical assistance, you have to open a new support ticket at our support forum from here -&gt; https://forum.tagdiv.com/forum/newspaper/ where you need to provide more details about your problem and we are ready to help you.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I recently updated the Newsmag theme to the latest release and activated Mobile + AMP in the theme panel.
Installed WP Super Cache as recommended.
I&#039;ve observed that suddenly the mobile site stops working and the site&#039;s responsive design starts getting displayed instead of the mobile theme.
Deleting the Cache fixes this but it keeps happening. Can you advice on what could be the possible reason?]]></description>

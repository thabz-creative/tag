Hi Zlaja, 

Thank you for reaching out. This seems to be an unusual situation, as the infinite scrolling functionality cannot be altered by not updating the theme. Can you please provide more details about this situation via email at contact@tagdiv.com? Unfortunately, the Blog area is not assigned to the Customer Support Department. We&#039;re ready to help! Thank you so much for understanding.]]></description>

Hi, 

Thank you for reaching out. At this moment, there is no option available to enable the infinite scrolling functionality within the Mobile theme. You can enable this feature only if you&#039;re using the customizable mobile pages. If you have more questions or need any technical help, please let us know via forum or by email, as the Blog is not assigned to the Customer Support Department. Thank you for understanding! Have a lovely day :)]]></description>

Hi Alina!

Thanks for the answer. I was unsure about the availability if this in single post templates in Mobile Pages - or Mobile Templates). Your answer confirmed what I was hopping!

About the support, thanks for the tip, but I already tried it and got no help...
Now, I am trying to resolve an issue with autoloading by myself.

Thank you! And have a great weekend!]]></description>

Hi Bruno! Thank you for reaching out to us. The infinite loading feature can be only enabled globally for Single Post Templates. It cannot be applied individually on pages, neither on mobile pages. The option to turn on or off the auto loading system can be accessed from the tagDiv Composer when you&#039;re editing your single post. If you need any assistance with your theme, please open a new topic in the forum or let us know by email. Thank you!]]></description>

Hi,

That is somewhat of a general question. There are topics online that mention the pros and cons of using infinite load in any form, for pages or posts. You could check a few of them, and decide if you should use it or not for your website, it is entirely optional. 

Thank you!]]></description>

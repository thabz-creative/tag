Hi Indra, 

Thank you for consider getting one of the tagDiv themes for your website. About your inquiry, that depends. The Envato license terms are mentioned here - https://themeforest.net/licenses/standard. If the subdomains are related to the same subject of the main site, a single license will be required. If the subdomains have no relation to each other or the main site and are about different things, they will each require a license key. If you have more pre-sale questions, please drop us an email at contact@tagdiv.com. We&#039;re looking forward to hearing from you! Have a lovely day :)]]></description>

Hi! Sure. You can use the same license theme on a subdirectory if you plan on creating a testing site, but if we are talking about totally different sites with different content, then only one theme per install is legally allowed. One theme license means one website. Thank you for understanding! If you need any technical assistance, please open a new topic on the forum or send us an email. We&#039;re always ready to help you out! Have a lovely day :)]]></description>

Hi Afonso! Thank you for your given interest. Covid19 Italy PRO is a pre-made demo design that comes included with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Newspaper WordPress Theme&lt;/a&gt; package. After you purchase a Newspaper theme license, you have to download the theme&#039;s package from your ThemeForest account, then install it onto your website. You do not have to choose the Newspaper theme version, as you&#039;ll buy the latest version available. If you have more pre-sale questions, please drop us an email at contact@tagdiv.com. Thank you!]]></description>

Hello,

Thank you for your interest in our theme. Unfortunately, our Newspaper theme has not been developed to support the RTL version. Also, please note that it is not an easy task to rewrite all the themeâ€™s functionality including the core page builder and required plugins to make it RTL; this means that the theme might be affected and we cannot provide support for this. Iâ€™m sorry! If you change your mind and want to build a website for the left to right language, please send us your pre-sale questions at contact@tagdiv.com, and we would be happy to assist you. 

Thank you for understanding!]]></description>

Hi,

You can use other caching plugins if you want, it isn&#039;t mandatory to use the super cache. Install the rocket cache, and try different configurations with settings it provides, while testing to see if the website looks/works fine. Some settings could cause problems. Overall the plugin should work fine with the theme. I don&#039;t have a guide for configuring the rocket cache unfortunately, at this time. Maybe one will be done in the future.  

Thank you!]]></description>

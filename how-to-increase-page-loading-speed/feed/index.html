Hi Matthew, 

Thank you for using our Newspaper theme. The page speed can be influenced by several factors that go beyond the theme&#039;s functionality. If you need our web development theme to investigate this and help you with custom web solutions, you can request a quote from our department here - https://tagdiv.com/submit-a-request/. Thank you! Have a lovely day :)]]></description>

Hi! Thank you for reaching out to us. The WP Super Cache is a great tool, but our customers also use LiteSpeed Cache or WP Rocket with our Newspaper theme. We recommend WP Super Cache because weâ€™re also using it on our websites. If you have more questions or need any help, please open a new topic in the forum or send us an email. Weâ€™re looking forward to assisting you! Have a lovely day.]]></description>

If you&#039;re already using WP Super Cache and all the aforementioned functionality and the site performs at its best, there&#039;s no need to use Autoptimize. If you want our support team to take a look at your site&#039;s performance, let us know via forum or by email. Thank you so much for understanding! Have a great day.]]></description>

Thanks for the reply but is there a need to use Autoptimize when you have activated minified scripts using cloudflare? Kindly note that I currently use WP Super cache, smush,  HTTP headers,  sucuri security and cloudflare]]></description>

Thank you for commenting. One recommendation would be to use the Autoptimze plugin. If you need any technical help, please let us know via forum or by email, as the Blog area is not assigned to the Customer Support Department. Thank you for understanding! Have a lovely day :)]]></description>

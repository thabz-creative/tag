Hi, 

Thank you for reaching out to us. You should definitely use the tagDiv Composer, as the eCommerce functionality is given by our page builder along the tagDiv Shop &amp; WooCommerce plugins. If you need technical help with your theme, please let us know via forum or by email, as the blog is not associated with the Customer Support Department. Thank you for understanding. Have a lovely day!]]></description>

<h2 id="h-bluehost-hosting-services-overview">Bluehost Hosting Services Overview</h2>



<h3 id="h-1-shared-wordpress-hosting">1. Shared WordPress Hosting</h3>



<p>The Bluehost <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bluehost.com/wordpress/wordpress-hosting" target="_blank">shared WordPress Hosting</a> was specially designed for clients that need resources, products, tools, and support to build their WordPress sites in a single place. If you’re considering buying WordPress hosting, you should consider one of the three hosting packages. Basic, Plus, and Choice Plus are the WordPress hosting available packages, and the pricing normally starts from $3.95/month, but if you use this link to opt for a hosting plan, it will start from $2.95. The Basic package is more limited than the others as it allows you only one website, 50 GB of SSD storage, five <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://my.bluehost.com/hosting/help/resource/79" target="_blank">parked domains</a>, and 25 subdomains, while the others two options include an unlimited number of websites, unmetered SSD storage, unlimited parked domains and subdomains, as well as one Microsoft 365 mailbox. They all have in common the free SSL certificate. If you choose the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/tagdiv" target="_blank">shared WordPress hosting option</a>, Bluehost will automatically install the latest version of WordPress and will keep it updated.</p>

Choose wisely, as the Build, Grow, and Scale include interesting options related to your site’s security, traffic, and web storage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-3-woocommerce-hosting">3. WooCommerce Hosting&nbsp;</h3>



<p>When you create a WooCommerce website, you need to ensure it’s backed by strong tools that keep everything under control in a safe and performant environment. Bluehost offers you the possibility of opting for a Standard or Premium <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/wordpress/woocommerce-hosting">WooCommerce hosting</a> package, starting with $15.95/month.

<p>VPS refers to <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/vps">Virtual Private Hosting</a> and guarantees you to use dedicated resources such as RAM, CPU, or Disk Space. As a VPS user, you have full control over the root access so you can perform commands and do any <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/tagdiv">hosting configuration</a> change. The Standard, Enhanced, and Ultimate pricing plans range from $19.99 to $59.99 monthly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bluehost is a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/top-of-the-best-web-hosting-services-to-buy-in-2020/">popular hosting provider</a> that offers you a multitude and variety of features and hosting services. It’s true that the more options you opt for, the more you’ll pay. However, the Bluehost company provides six hosting types you can choose from and their pricing rates are affordable. They are either cheap and basic, or expensive and extensive. Also, for <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-recognized-as-the-top-web-development-company-of-2020/">your website to run smoothly</a> you’ll also need a powerful, flexible, and performant WordPress template. There are so many customers that have chosen Newspaper or Newsmag themes to easily build their websites hosted on one of the Bluehost’s servers. If you’re a WordPress beginner and looking out for a hosting service, you should definitely go for the Bluehost Shared Hosting plan. As a recommendation, you could save some great money opting for an annual hosting fee instead of monthly payments.</p>

<p>Are you looking for the best web hosting services to buy in 2021? If to start blogging or boosting the speed of your website is a new year resolution, and you took your time to analyze the offer, then this article may help you decide. Three months have already passed, but it&#8217;s never too late for a change. What do you want for your website in 2021? For example, if you want to try out another hosting provider or need a better one, keep on reading. This guide has everything you need to know about web hosting services, from pricing, shared hosting, WordPress hosting to VPS, and dedicated servers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-you-need-to-know-about-web-hosting">What You Need To Know About Web Hosting</h2>



<p>&#8220;A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies that provide space on a server owned or leased for use by clients, as well as providing Internet connectivity, typically in a data center.&#8221; This is what the virtual Wikipedia encyclopedia has to say about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">web hosting service</a>. It is a very technical explanation, but how else would it be? There are so many people that own a website but don&#8217;t even know what exactly it took to see it up and running. Nothing about domains, WordPress, themes, pages, posts, web hosting services, site optimization, and speed. </p>



<p>Moreover, people normally don&#8217;t surf the web thinking about what each website uses, what host, on what domain, why it&#8217;s not <em>https </em>or that images take too long to load due to their size. Internet users navigate and return to websites that perform faster and deliver accurate and relevant information for them. If a website takes too long to load, it may be due to having too many JavaScript files, a poorly optimized database, caching issues, huge media files, and others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what exactly does web hosting refer to? WP Beginner published an article last year called &#8220;What&#8217;s<a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/whats-the-difference-between-domain-name-and-web-hosting-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the Difference between domain name and web hosting</a>,&#8221; and they made an analogy between domains &amp; hosts and home &amp; physical addresses. This is a great comparison that can be easily understood by anyone. </p>



<p>For years, people used personal computers as servers for their websites, because it was the most reliable and secure thing they could do. However, if there were electricity or Internet issues, then the website was also down, not functioning. With technology evolving, web hosting services have rapidly grown in popularity.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-web-hosting-providers-store">What Web Hosting Providers Store?</h2>



<p>Web hosting services store all your website&#8217;s files, assets, and databases on their servers. When someone types your domain name into their browsers, the web host responds and delivers the needed data. So, basically, your website and all its content is placed in a rented virtual space. In the background of a website there are programs, plugins, and functionalities that run to support its dynamics and interactivity. All of these files count to the storage quantity that your website will occupy on the servers. This is an essential part when choosing your hosting provider. Depending on the site&#8217;s measures, you can choose the perfect pricing plan.</p>



<h2 id="h-website-management-services">Website Management Services&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Web hosting providers also offer website management services, including one-click WordPress, Drupal or other CMS installs, regular &amp; automated site backups, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-hosted-email-providers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted email solutions</a>, intuitive user interface, collaboration tools, secure environments, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-look-for-when-choosing-a-web-hosting">What to Look For When Choosing a Web Hosting?</h2>



<p>From my point of view, the first and most important reason for choosing a provider is their trustworthiness. Then, you need to find out what type of hosting you are looking for: Shared Hosting, Dedicated Server Hosting, Virtual Private Server (VSP) Hosting, or Cloud hosting. Furthermore, you should also consider these characteristics:</p>



<ul><li>Uptime and load time&nbsp;</li><li>Bandwidth usage</li><li>SSL and Wildcard SSL (also for subdomains) certificates &#8211; only if you haven&#8217;t them already</li><li>Cloud, email, WordPress (or other CMS install), VPS, cPanel access, PowerCacher, WildcardSSL</li><li>Unlimited SSD storage</li><li>Unlimited data transfers</li><li>Money-back guarantee</li></ul>

<p>I&#8217;ve analyzed the best web hosting services available today, especially to host WordPress websites. Below, I&#8217;ve highlighted the best feature of every web hosting provider to make your choice easier:</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-left" id="h-is-pricing-the-defining-aspect">Is Pricing the Defining Aspect?</h2>



<p>In short? Yes. Pricing will always be a defining aspect when buying any service or product. You always get what you pay for. Cheap Hosting means cheap service &#8211; that&#8217;s why we haven&#8217;t talked about tons of hosting services at low costs. There are so many hosting services out there that we haven&#8217;t even heard of. Let&#8217;s stick to the most popular ones when choosing our web host.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A thing you should be aware of is that hosting companies might use pricing tricks. These are usually pricing packages that are cheap at first, but they get increased after a few months of usage. However, if you want your website to perform at its best, it means that servers, networks, logging response times must be at high standards. And this always comes at a price.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-15982 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cloudways-Server-Applpication.jpg" alt="Cloudways Hosting - management" width="1200" height="379" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cloudways-Server-Applpication.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cloudways-Server-Applpication-300x95.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cloudways-Server-Applpication-1024x323.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cloudways-Server-Applpication-768x243.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cloudways-Server-Applpication-696x220.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cloudways-Server-Applpication-1068x337.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>With any Cloudways plan, you’ll get free hourly backups. Their admin panel is easy to learn by the new users. When it comes to a management panel, beginners who are not that tech savvy, need to have easy access to their domains/subdomains, WordPress install, make or restore backups. That’s why, some people may say that managed hosting <a href="https://tagdiv.com/kinsta-hosting-review/">dashboards</a> are better than using the popular cPanel.</p>
<h2>Managed Hosting for WordPress websites</h2>
<p>The Cloudways team included a full plan for <a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/wordpress-cloud-hosting.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">managed WordPress</a> hosting services. It means you get features such as scaling and cloning to backups, restores, and many more. Furthermore, during your site’s deployment, ThunderStack optimization recipe will impress you. It combines the Varnish, Memcached, Apache, and Nginx features to ensure a better speed and increase the website’s performance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-15986 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cloudways-Pricing.jpg" alt="Cloudways Hosting - Pricing" width="859" height="465" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cloudways-Pricing.jpg 859w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cloudways-Pricing-300x162.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cloudways-Pricing-768x416.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cloudways-Pricing-696x377.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px" /></p>
<p>It frequently happens that users don’t consume all their hosting resources but still paying for it. Since Cloudways offers a Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) pricing model, it means users only pay for the hosting they use. With this company, you can host unlimited websites on the same server.</p>
<p>For those of you who want to change their host, the Cloudways team offers the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bv-cloudways-automated-migration/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Free WordPress Migrator</a>, which is a plugin that automatically migrates your site on their managed WordPress hosting server. In case you need assistance, Cloudways team provides one free managed migration.</p>
<h2>Global Locations for Your Cloud Server</h2>
<p>Managed WordPress hosting has <a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/wordpress-cloud-hosting.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">60+ data centers</a> all over the world. You can choose the server’s location based on 15 countries, and even pick a city from a list of 33 major ones around the globe.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-15978 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Global-recognition.png" alt="Cloudways - Global Locations" width="747" height="435" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Global-recognition.png 747w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Global-recognition-300x175.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Global-recognition-696x405.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /></p>
<p>To show beautiful posts and images with the speed of light, you need more than a powerful host. You also need to study the market and find the right theme fit. It’s better to choose <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a template</a>, well-known in the industry, and you’ll avoid bouncing between themes to find a complete solution to your needs.</p>
<h3>Cloud Hosting for Developers &amp; Web Agencies</h3>
<p>If you are a developer, after you’ve selected the server, you also get to choose the CMS you need to build your website on such as WordPress, Magento, PHP, Joomla, PrestaShop, and others. Take your site up and running using the <a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/cloudwaysbot.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CloudwaysBot</a>, a tool that assists you with tips and recommendations to optimize servers and applications in real-time. As a developer, you can use the popular MySQL or MariaDB for the database management systems.</p>
<p>If you are part of a web agency and design WordPress sites for different clients, Cloudways has a package, called “<a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/agencies-hosting-solution.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Cloud Hosting for Web Agencies </a>” which offers unlimited websites on the chosen server, SMTP add-ons, security patching, and managed migrations. All these happen on a dedicated server, which you don&#8217;t share with anyone else.</p>
<h2>Cloudways Hosting &#8211; User Experience Oriented</h2>
<p>What we found the most useful at Cloudways services is the user’s ability to select by himself the server’s locations, cloud hosting provider &amp; applications. Avoid slowing down your website or getting it completely offline due to high spikes of traffic, by making some quick tweaks.</p>
<p>After sending a newsletter, social media posts, or viral videos through different channels, your website might receive huge amounts of traffic. It’s the moment when you should start paying attention to bandwidth and server capacity to host your site. Fortunately, by using the <a href="https://support.cloudways.com/how-to-increase-server-resources/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">vertical scaling</a>, Cloudways allows you to add more power such as CPU or RAM resources to your servers, making them faster and perform better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Founded in 2006 by Jamie Opalchuk, HostPapa is known as a popular Canadian web hosting company. It offers multiple hosting services, suitable for any online business. Divided into five categories, the HostPapa services are a great solution for your forum, eCommerce or WordPress website. <a href="https://www.hostpapa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HostPapa</a> offers Shared, WordPress, VPS, Reseller, and Online Store Hosting.</p>
<h2>What’s the meaning of the HostPapa&#8217;s name?</h2>
<p>I am not sure if you feel the same as I do. I find hosting services&#8217; names interesting. They are all different yet most give you the idea of parental care or fulfilling dreams. For example, HostPapa is a combination of two words: “host” and “papa.” The last one means “father,” a model who takes care of you and your needs. Other examples are GoDaddy, HostGator, and DreamHost. So, is HostPapa a hassle-free solution for your website?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6990 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/support.jpg" alt="Amazing Support HostPapa Hosting" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/support.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/support-300x200.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/support-768x512.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/support-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/support-696x464.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/support-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/support-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>A word about safety</h2>
<p>Nowadays it’s essential to get your website secure. And the most important thing is to get an authorized document to certify it. If it’s for free, the better for you. All the three WordPress hosting plans by HostPapa include a free Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate for your website. The <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISRG</a> team says that through this certificate <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">authority</a> they “give people the digital certificates they need in order to enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for websites, for free, in the most user-friendly way we can. We do this because we want to create a more secure and privacy-respecting Web.”</p>
<p>What this means is that visitors will definitely want to check out the content you’ve published, as they feel secure while accessing your site. If your audience sees a red warning box telling them the connection is not private, they’re probably not going further to navigate through your great content. Not only does HostPapa provide you with a free SSL certificate, but also with an encryption method up to 256-bit. Your website’s data can travel over a network in a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/top-of-the-best-web-hosting-services-to-buy-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secure environment</a>.</p>
<h2>Recommended domains for you</h2>
<p>Choose a <a href="https://www.hostpapa.eu/domains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domain</a> extension that fits your website’s name. HostPapa recommends you these five domains: .com, .net, .xys, .website, .online. If you’ve registered a domain name, you can have multiple Top-Level Domains attached. Furthermore, with an extra <a href="https://www.hostpapa.eu/email/overview/">email</a> solution from HostPapa, you can match your brand identity with your name. The hosting company offers free domain transfer or free website migrations and promises to support you in these procedures.</p>
<h2>WordPress Hosting by HostPapa</h2>
<p>With HostPapa you can select between three pricing plans for WordPress: WP Starter, Business, or Business Pro. While WP Starter is advertised as a useful tool for WordPress newbies or starting blogs, the other two options can be a great acquisition for any small or large online business, with improved security, high performance, and fast loading speed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6987 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pricing.jpg" alt="Pricing for HostPapa Hosting" width="1200" height="913" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pricing.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pricing-300x228.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pricing-768x584.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pricing-1024x779.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pricing-80x60.jpg 80w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pricing-696x530.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pricing-1068x813.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pricing-552x420.jpg 552w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>If you have one or two websites, would you rather rely on limited disk space or go beyond the restrictions and opt for never-ending facilities? All the WordPress Hosting kits come packed with the latest WP version installed, the cPanel admin interface, Free SSL certificate by Let’s Encrypt, Cloudflare CDN, and unlimited bandwidth for your data transfer. HostPapa powers its data centers with renewable energy and hosts over 500K sites, starting at the low price of $3.95/month. The HostPapa offers technical support in multiple languages, such as English, French, Spanish, and German.</p>
<h3>Strong Features you’ll get with any of the pricing plans:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Unlimited bandwidth usage</li>
<li>Free WordPress installation or migration</li>
<li>With WP Super Cache and Varnish plugins, your site loads faster</li>
<li>Free Let&#8217;s Encrypt SSL certificate</li>
<li>WPForms plugin included</li>
<li>Brute force attack protection</li>
<li>Downtime monitoring</li>
<li>24/7 FTP access, and FTPS (SSL/TLS)</li>
<li>Access to cPanel control panel through HostPapa Dashboard</li>
<li>Server firewall, monitoring, and intrusion detection</li>
<li>DDoS attack prevention and responses</li>
<li>Network monitoring</li>
<li>Account statistics</li>
<li>99.9% uptime</li>
</ol>
<p>If you opt for the WP Business Pro package, you get premium features such as daily automated backups, automatic security fixes, spam filtering, and malware scanning. Moreover, this plan comes with Google Analytics integration and SEO preview tools.</p>
<p>If you’re in a hurry and want to design a site for your business, HostPapa has other services you might be interested in. For example, they can build the website for you, as part of the managed <a href="https://www.hostpapa.com/website-builder/do-it-for-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Do-It-For-Me</a> web design service.</p>
<h2>HostPapa users call upon for help</h2>
<p>A reliable product or service is one that’s well supported. The HostPapa provides you with technical assistance through different channels. Whether you choose to get advice over the phone, chat, or by changing emails, HostPapa team supports you. Furthermore, if you want to check out the network status, there’s a dedicated landing page with real-time reports <a href="https://hostpapastatus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6989 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/customer-care.jpg" alt="Customer Care Hostpapa Hosting" width="1200" height="715" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/customer-care.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/customer-care-300x179.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/customer-care-768x458.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/customer-care-1024x610.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/customer-care-696x415.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/customer-care-1068x636.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/customer-care-705x420.jpg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Get a jump on website design</h2>
<p>While HostPapa has its own drag and drop <a href="https://www.hostpapa.com/website-builder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Website Builder</a>, it’s easier to focus on a WordPress website. All you need to do is to find the theme for your project. Quite often, people choose free themes for their initial sites. With time passing, they create content and want to highlight it within a beautiful layout. So, they search for a premium theme to help them make their dreams come true. Whether it’s a website about travel, sports, home design, or a gossip magazine, with flexible tools and an intuitive interface, you’ll nail it. There are powerful templates out there, though you need not look any further than Newspaper or Newsmag. While <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newspaper</a> theme is an entirely front-end WordPress Theme and offers tons of easy customizations, <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newsmag-news-magazine-newspaper/9512331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsmag</a> comes with a minimal layout.</p>
<h2>Is it worth your attention?</h2>
<p>Definitely. Since the World Wide Web is full of attractive hosting packages, do you feel confident with your choice? If you find yourself in an impasse and need more arguments to take a decision, you might want to pay attention to a few <a href="https://www.hostpapa.com/why-hostpapa/top-5-reasons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">details</a>. Some brand strategies focus on keywords and trustworthy facts about their company. HostPapa team says that they’re totally committed to meet customer’s satisfaction, and have a reliable web hosting that users can count on. Have you tried any of the HostPapa WordPress hosting services? If you did so, please share your experience with tagDiv’s community, in the comments below?.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kinsta is a specialized hosting company founded in 2013 by a team of professional WordPress developers and it’s powered by Google Cloud Platform. No matter if you’re a beginner or an advanced developer, Kinsta could be a good solution for you. They say they have a 100% rate for solving clients’ issues, with a support service available 24/7, 365 days a year.</p>
<h2>Is it worth taking a look?</h2>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinsta hosting</a> comes with an intuitive admin interface, daily backups, and provides site’s migrations. Also, you can take your work up on staging environments and publish when you’re ready.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6742 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-features.jpg" alt="Kinsta Features" width="1200" height="693" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-features.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-features-300x173.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-features-768x444.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-features-1024x591.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-features-696x402.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-features-1068x617.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-features-727x420.jpg 727w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>When people approach hosting services for their websites, they first look into speed, security, and backups. Few of them take this further and think of running their businesses from anywhere without inconsistent delivery. Kinsta offers all these, and it also lets you manage your resources and focus on site content.<br />
There must be a reason some of the Fortune 500 clients like GE, Intuit, Drift, Buffer, and MariaDB, Tripadvisor, Asos, Ubisoft use Kinsta services.<br />
TL;DR &#8211; Definitely!</p>
<h2>Downtime? No worries</h2>
<p>Powered by the Google Cloud Platform and its Premium Tier network, Kinsta’s aim was to <a href="https://tagdiv.com/top-of-the-best-web-hosting-services-to-buy-in-2020/">optimize its performance</a> and become a strong, reliable, and secure WordPress hosting service for its customers. The Google team of experts wrote a comprehensive study case about the Kinsta hosting, and mention that “On the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/kinsta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud Platform</a> infrastructure, with live migration and data redundancy features, Kinsta and its clients don&#8217;t have to worry about extended, unexpected downtime.” Google is a trusty global company, and it’s constantly improving the optic network speed, reaching over 10,000TB per second. Just think about how fast loads something you type in Google Search, your Gmail conversations or the videos you play on YouTube. These Google services and others are using the Premium Tier Network that performs requests within high-quality speed. And that’s just one reason to take your website for a driving test on a managed Kinsta host.</p>
<h2>What is the page loading speed?</h2>
<p>On their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a> about the Cloud locations, Google says that their platform “meets rigorous privacy and compliance standards that test for data safety, privacy, and security.” So, as a Kinsta customer and WordPress user, you can select from over 18 global data center locations to match your sites closer to your visitors. If your audience is mainly from Belgium, Frankfurt, to Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and anything in between, positioning your WordPress installs closer, will ensure lower latency and a faster page loading speed.<br />
From small websites to large ones, Kinsta can host any WordPress blog. To get outstanding results, besides a great host, your WordPress theme must be well coded and optimized for speed. For example, <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newspaper</a> and <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newsmag-news-magazine-newspaper/9512331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsmag</a> themes are built from ground up with a clean code structure and with a host like Kinsta, your website will load fast. You can always check out the servers’ <a href="https://status.kinsta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">status</a> and see in real time how’s the uptime going.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6744 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-status.jpg" alt="Kinsta Page Speed" width="1200" height="729" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-status.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-status-300x182.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-status-768x467.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-status-1024x622.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-status-696x423.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-status-1068x649.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kinsta-status-691x420.jpg 691w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>MyKinsta &#8211; Your Control Center</h2>
<p>For better user experience, Kinsta uses the <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LXD</a> and <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LXC</a> systems to create container management. Each WordPress website has its private container that includes the required software resources to run properly such as Linux, Nginx, PHP or MySQL.</p>

<p>From the panel called “MyKinsta”, you can manage all your websites that use their WordPress hosting services. This interface lets you create SSL certificates, track visitors, bandwidth usage, response times, and many more. Also, you can give access to more people in your team.</p>
<p>While other companies might offer shared hosting, Kinsta doesn’t. Neither of the unique containers shares information between others, or even your own WordPress websites (if you have multiple ones). Kinsta offers support for complex framework installations, such as Bedrock, reverse proxy configurations, while giving access to SSH and WP-CLI features on all their pricing plans.</p>
<p>Depending on your monthly <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/count-visits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">site’s visits</a>, Kinsta offers four attractive <a href="https://kinsta.com/plans/?plan=visits-starter&amp;interval=month" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pricing</a> offers:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you’re new to WordPress and want to start a business, there are a lot of things to consider, like finding a <a href="https://hosting.review/best-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">suitable</a> WordPress hosting provider. This is not an easy choice you have to make, as it depends on various facts — a fast and secure host, with site-staging, free migrations, and so on. In today’s article, we’ll take a look at the A2 Hosting services.</p>
<h2>A little bit of history</h2>
<p>Did you know that <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">A2 Hosting</a> previous name was “Iniquinet”? Later, in 2003, this company was renamed as A2 Hosting, to be easily recognized by everyone. Where’s the A coming? You’re probably asking. Well, the business is located in Ann Arbor, Michigan &#8211; USA so, A is from the Ann Arbor.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6870 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting.jpg" alt="A2 Hosting Geo Location" width="1200" height="718" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting-300x180.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting-768x460.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting-1024x613.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting-696x416.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting-1068x639.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting-702x420.jpg 702w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>It is an independent hosting company with four data centers so you can choose the location as Michigan &#8211; USA, Arizona &#8211; USA, Amsterdam-Europe, or Singapore &#8211; Asia. You can choose the server’s location. This is important because the closer your content is to your visitors, the faster your content will be delivered. It improves the site’s loading speed by shortening the physical distance.</p>
<p>A2 provides several hosting services, like Shared Hosting, Managed WordPress, Reseller Hosting, VPS hosting, Cloud Hosting, Dedicated Server Hosting.</p>
<h2>WordPress Hosting or Managed WordPress Hosting?</h2>
<p>We’re tackling the classical question and try to give you a comprehensive answer. All the A2 Hosting plans use the SwiftServer infrastructure. Based on the chosen server location, <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/swiftservers-fast-hosting" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">SwiftServer</a> is a speed optimized platform where servers use free Solid-State Drives &#8211; SSD, CloudFlare Servershield CDN, or LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress.</p>
<h2>A2 Hosting Pricing Plan</h2>
<p>A2 comes with several options for hosting services such as Shared Hosting, Reseller Hosting, VPS hosting, Cloud Hosting, and Dedicated Server Hosting. The pricing ranges from €3.44 to €87.49/month.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border aligncenter wp-image-6845 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pricing.jpg" alt="A2 Hosting Services" width="1200" height="801" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pricing.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pricing-300x200.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pricing-768x513.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pricing-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pricing-696x465.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pricing-1068x713.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pricing-629x420.jpg 629w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />You can choose between a shared or managed WordPress Hosting plan. But now it gets complicated as each of these plans has multiple pricing offers. You should select the one that gives you the best solution to your needs.</p>
<h2>A2 Shared WordPress Hosting</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/wordpress-hosting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Shared WordPress Hosting</a> solution comes with three pricing plans. They have a few similarities you might take into consideration while reflecting which one is the best for you. All the three pricing plans give you access to unlimited Raid-10 Storage, Transfer, and Solid State Drive Speed boost within the Complete SSD solution to your files, OS &amp; Database. They also offer a Free SSL certificate via Let’s Encrypt.</p>
<p>The Swift and Turbo plans offer an unlimited number of websites, domains, and subdomains. The Turbo package includes some plugins that increase the site’s speed such as WordPress LiteSpeed Cache.</p>
<h2>A2 Managed WordPress Hosting</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/wordpress-hosting/managed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Managed WordPress hosting</a> also comes with three packages for you: 1-website, 3-sites, and an unlimited number of websites.</p>
<p>So, is shared or Managed WordPress WordPress <a href="https://tagdiv.com/top-of-the-best-web-hosting-services-to-buy-in-2020/" rel="noopener">hosting service right</a> for you?<br />
Shared hosting is for those of you who are ready to go for a lower cost host solution. This could be a choice if your website is new-entry, with not so much traffic. The Shared hosting package comes with the cPanel control panel, and you can see when some of the resources meet the limit (such as CPU and MEM usage).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border aligncenter wp-image-6848 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wp-management.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="627" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wp-management.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wp-management-300x157.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wp-management-768x401.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wp-management-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wp-management-696x364.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wp-management-1068x558.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wp-management-804x420.jpg 804w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>A managed hosting has everything already configured for your WordPress website. It frees you from the maintenance of your sites like the setup, plugins or theme updates. Though it’s a more expensive service, the Managed WordPress hosting has automatic, optimized tools and increased performance. It settles for a low number of sites on the same server and uses a custom designed admin panel, which is better for the user. Also, with this kind of plan you don’t have to worry about updates, caching, HTML, CSS or JS file minification.</p>
<h2>What’s an A2 Turbo Server?</h2>
<p>A2 Hosting is well-known for its statement of having a Turbo Server option that allows pages to load everything up to 20x faster. This kind of server uses a speed boost Apache alternative. The users get more resources while fewer users (websites) share the same server. The main benefits are that they can host unlimited websites, sub-domains, add-ons or parked domains, RAID-10 Storage, Server Rewind Backups, and more.</p>
<p>These Turbo Servers include more caching solutions than the others and can be customized with the A2 Optimized WP plugin which integrates options with the functionality given by third-party plugins to increase your site’s speed and security.</p>
<p>To improve the pages’ performance, the caching solutions store in memory key pieces of the website, instead of loading every page portion each time the site is accessed. This option could be a good choice if your website gets a lot of traffic.</p>
<h2>Who Manages the WordPress Setup in A2?</h2>
<p>By choosing the Managed WordPress Hosting, the A2 team assures they take care of the whole WordPress setup, while your access to the Plesk control panel is granted. Furthermore, as A2 has the <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/blog/wp-cli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">WP CLI</a> installed by default, you can manage your WordPress sites using the command-line tool. This means you can update plugins and configure multiple websites installs, without using a web browser.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border aligncenter wp-image-6847 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shared-managed-hosting.jpg" alt="A2 Hosting - control panels" width="1200" height="603" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shared-managed-hosting.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shared-managed-hosting-300x151.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shared-managed-hosting-768x386.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shared-managed-hosting-1024x515.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shared-managed-hosting-696x350.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shared-managed-hosting-1068x537.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shared-managed-hosting-836x420.jpg 836w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>One more step: Finding the right WP theme</h2>
<p>By now, I’m sure you already have a powerful theme in your mind to help you make a great online presence. You can choose from a free theme WordPress repository, or you can take it to another level with a premium theme form a market like ThemeForest. If you’re looking for a news, blog, or magazine oriented template, your choice should be the best-selling <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newspaper</a> theme which offers you entirely <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/" rel="noopener">front-end</a> customization possibilities for posts and pages. With a boxed layout, another popular theme to fit your sport, medical, traveling or tech website might be <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newsmag-news-magazine-newspaper/9512331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsmag</a>.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Featuring some new technologies to speed up your website, the A2 Hosting gives you multiple options you can choose from.

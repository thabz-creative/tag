<p>With the new year sneaking up on us (haha, not really, let’s be honest about it, we’ve been waiting for this!), Pantone has released their Colors of the Year 2021 in a public announcement.</p>



<p>A symbolic union between two colors: the ever stable, neutral shade, <span style="background-color:#939597" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Ultimate Gray</span> and its playful, optimistic counterpart, <span style="background-color:#f5df4e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Illuminating</span>. Now, how does this impact the year 2021? Let’s answer that question by exploring the significance of the colors above and how to best implement them into your new design projects.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="660" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/monochromatic-scheme-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray.jpg" alt="monochromatic scheme illuminating and ultimate gray" class="wp-image-15750" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/monochromatic-scheme-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/monochromatic-scheme-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/monochromatic-scheme-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/monochromatic-scheme-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/monochromatic-scheme-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-696x383.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/monochromatic-scheme-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-1068x587.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2 id="h-illuminating-ultimate-gray">Illuminating &amp; Ultimate Gray</h2>



<p>As warm as the color of the sun, <span style="background-color:#f5df4e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Illuminating</span> is a powerful yellow color that brings joy to everyone around. During the 17th century France, the Age of Enlightenment, yellow was seen as the color that shed light upon people’s ignorance. Nowadays, the color seems to be mostly associated with joy, energy, and positivity. A burst of happiness, one would say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contrast to that, <span style="background-color:#939597" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Ultimate Gray</span> is a relatively sober color, usually associated with sadness and even negativity in some cases. Gray is a dull color, but it’s always been a reliable one. As a neutral shade, it creates a perfect foundation just like how people used to make their homes out of pebbles, rocks, which were… gray! Moreover, more and more people opt for <a href="https://tagdiv.com/design-trends-minimalism-newspaper-theme/">minimalist</a> lifestyles, and for example, <span style="background-color:#939597" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Ultimate Gray</span> is a color that dominates home design and creates great contrasts between white walls, wood elements, and more.</p>



<p>This union between a stable and an optimistic color is what Pantone wants the outlook of 2021 to be. After the tumultuous year of 2020, embracing what we currently have and striving for the world’s betterment and others is an ideal, a goal, a solution. Falling in line perfectly with <a href="https://www.pantone.com/uk/en/color-of-the-year-2021">Pantone’s view of the situation</a>: “The union of an enduring <span style="background-color:#939597" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Ultimate Gray</span> with the vibrant yellow <span style="background-color:#f5df4e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Illuminating</span> expresses a message of positivity supported by fortitude. Practical and rock-solid but at the same time warming and optimistic, this is a colour combination that gives us resilience and hope. We need to feel encouraged and uplifted; this is essential to the human spirit.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-color-schemes-inspiration">Color Schemes &amp; Inspiration</h2>



<p>Whether you plan on using the hues separately or together, you need to know some color combinations. If you’re new to this, you can always check out our tutorial on <a href="https://tagdiv.com/color-theory-newspaper-theme/">Color Theory</a> to get a better understanding of the basics. First of all, let’s tackle the colors separately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For <span style="background-color:#f5df4e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Illuminating</span>, we have the analogous &amp; monochromatic schemes, which involve using different shades of yellow. Analogous uses colors that are very close neighbours to the yellow, whereas monochromatic just ups the yellow contrast. The color complementary to it is a dark shade of violet-blue. Triad relies on creating a beautiful union between Illuminating, cyan, and a deep shade of pink-purple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we approach <span style="background-color:#939597" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Ultimate Gray</span> with the same situation, we have an easier time as it is a neutral shade. It technically goes with every color. So monochromatic, analogous, triad, and complementary schemes all use different shades of gray.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keeping everything in mind about the colors themselves, you can make a beautiful combination between <span style="background-color:#f5df4e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Illuminating</span> &amp; <span style="background-color:#939597" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Ultimate Gray</span> . All you would need is some inspiration. For this, you can always use <a href="https://color.adobe.com/explore">Adobe Color</a> to explore different shades. Moreover, Pantone offered some <a href="https://www.pantone.com/uk/en/color-of-the-year-2021-palette-exploration">color schemes for the Colors of the Year 2021</a> that you can also check out. Sticking to more shades of gray and different hues of yellow is a good starting point. You could also add cyan and violet in between the yellow and gray to create a bold, enjoyable look. Let your inspiration run wild and create a unique design!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="660" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-website-design-with-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray.jpg" alt="Website design with Ultimate Gray &amp; Illuminating" class="wp-image-15753" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-website-design-with-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-website-design-with-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-website-design-with-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-website-design-with-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-website-design-with-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-696x383.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-website-design-with-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-1068x587.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2 id="h-design-motives-with-newspaper-theme">Design Motives with Newspaper Theme</h2>



<p>Before embarking on a new design project, please choose the color scheme you want to work with and stick with it. Whether you’re creating a new website or just modifying something you already own, you can freshen it up and reveal a whole new look. Since Newspaper Theme allows users to craft everything on the front-end, take inspiration from your favorite websites to start designing!</p>



<p>Here are a few suggestions for the people who want more than that and are waiting for examples. Change the background color to the row by going into the “CSS” tab and picking out the hex code for <span style="background-color:#f5df4e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Illuminating</span>, which is, by the way, #F5DF4D. Now change the text color for your Flex Blocks or any other items in the row to <span style="background-color:#939597" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Ultimate Gray</span>, which has the hex code #939597.</p>



<p>That’s a sure-fire way to spruce up your page! However, if you something a little bit different, you could also create highlights with <span style="background-color:#f5df4e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Illuminating</span> on gray backgrounds. This could be applied in so many ways depending on whether you opted to use any other colors as well.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="850" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-more-somber-look.jpg" alt="A more somber look for your website" class="wp-image-15754" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-more-somber-look.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-more-somber-look-300x213.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-more-somber-look-1024x725.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-more-somber-look-768x544.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-more-somber-look-696x493.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-more-somber-look-1068x757.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>

<p>As with every year that comes around, a new attitude begins to bloom. Influenced by a wave of social perspective, marketing, and advertising shifts to complement it. With a turmoil brewing underneath the seams internationally, Pantone chose classic blue as 2020’s color of the year. How does one color make a massive impact on design and media trends? Let’s explore its meanings and the vast possibilities of creation together.</p>



<h2>Classic Blue: Meanings</h2>



<p>When the social and cultural environment shifts and begins to change, everyone tries to cling to something that has always been constant. Just like a sunset which welcomes the cold of the night, classic blue is present in various aspects of anyone’s daily life. It can appear on the surface of any deep pool of water, the sky at night, and even in design or art.</p>



<p>To have a stable future, you need a solid foundation, and that’s where this color comes into play. With its evocative nature of peace, clarity, and even protection, the color takes precedence over any doubts or qualms anyone might have. This is precisely what is needed in such an unstable environment, such as the year of 2020. It helps with concentration and brings a sense of resilience.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="776" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Create-posters-easily-with-triadic-color-palette-classic-blue.jpg" alt="Create posters easily with triadic color palette classic blue" class="wp-image-12783" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Create-posters-easily-with-triadic-color-palette-classic-blue.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Create-posters-easily-with-triadic-color-palette-classic-blue-300x194.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Create-posters-easily-with-triadic-color-palette-classic-blue-1024x662.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Create-posters-easily-with-triadic-color-palette-classic-blue-768x497.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Create-posters-easily-with-triadic-color-palette-classic-blue-696x450.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Create-posters-easily-with-triadic-color-palette-classic-blue-1068x691.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>To Blue or not to Blue?</h2>



<p>If you’re running a company that needs a boost in its traffic, one of the best ways to achieve that is to redesign one of your projects. Trusting the front-runner of all things color-related, Pantone, is a great choice. Their decision for 2020’s color of the year comes with its own merits. Companies, marketers, and even designers have incorporated classic blue into their art, projects, and social media posts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paying close attention to other <a href="https://tagdiv.com/seven-design-trends-for-2020/">design trends that are popular right now</a> can also help you create something entirely stunning and different. And when your audience is happy with your product, they can spread the word and boost your sales and traffic.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Color Schemes</h2>



<p>Any project or product needs a plan before you start it. One of the main aspects is choosing a color palette that defines it and your own design perspective. To better understand why colors play such an essential role in creation, head on over to our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/color-theory-newspaper-theme/">Color Theory tutorial</a>.</p>



<p>One of the first things that needs to be decided is the type of color scheme you need:</p>



<ul><li>A <strong>monochromatic</strong> scheme would involve different shades of blue being used and weaved in between elements to create contrast and attract the viewer’s eye. It’s simple and direct, effective, and meaningful.</li><li><strong>Analogous</strong> is both harmonious and eloquent in getting a design started as it involves colors on the right and left side of the color you’ve chosen: purple and green shades. These hues, paired with classic blue, evoke a mysterious aura and feeling.</li><li>The <strong>color-complementary</strong> would be brown or cream. A royal or navy palette presents dark colors which are majestic in nature.</li><li>The <strong>triadic</strong> color scheme requires both lime green and red hues as the counterparts to classic blue. A rather fun color palette that can also be used to evoke a neon, futuristic style, or even a serious, somber outlook.</li></ul>



<p>If you need more inspiration, go to <a href="https://color.adobe.com/search?q=0f4c81&amp;t=hex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adobe Color</a> and explore some of the user-made color palettes that involve classic blue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Analogous-Color-Scheme-for-Classic-Blue-in-a-geometric-design.jpg" alt="Analogous Color Scheme for Classic Blue in a geometric design" class="wp-image-12782" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Analogous-Color-Scheme-for-Classic-Blue-in-a-geometric-design.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Analogous-Color-Scheme-for-Classic-Blue-in-a-geometric-design-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Analogous-Color-Scheme-for-Classic-Blue-in-a-geometric-design-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Analogous-Color-Scheme-for-Classic-Blue-in-a-geometric-design-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Analogous-Color-Scheme-for-Classic-Blue-in-a-geometric-design-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Analogous-Color-Scheme-for-Classic-Blue-in-a-geometric-design-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Designing with Classic Blue</h2>



<p>When you’ve chosen a color scheme to go with, you can begin your design process. Go into your preferred software of expertise and implement classic blue as the main color of it, and adding other shades as accent hues. This can be applied to anything you create:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>If you want to incorporate these colors in your painting, you can try forming a neon-futuristic landscape inspired by cyberpunk themes. Or even take a standard-setting and switch up colors &#8211; the grass isn’t green anymore, it’s blue, and so forth.</li><li>As an animator or 3D artist, you may need to plan out the way your project should go before you start work on it. With your plan set and knowing what you want to show, you can implement the color scheme to match it.</li><li>Illustrations and posters can be retouched by adding gradients or splashes of color that make it excitingly stunning. If you need inspiration, take a look at <a href="https://www.behance.net/search/projects/?search=classic%20blue&amp;sort=recommended&amp;time=month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Behance’s projects</a>.</li><li>When you redesign or create a new website, you have to think of the layout and the user experience before you start. The moment you have all the elements together, you can always change the color scheme to match the one you’ve chosen as your color palette.</li></ul>



<p>Keep in mind that even if you don&#8217;t find yourself targeted in this list, you can still create something unique with the chosen color scheme. Experiment, have fun, and don’t let anything constrain your creativity!</p>

<h2>Newspaper Theme &amp; Classic blue</h2>



<p>Our front-end page-builder, the tagDiv Composer, makes any design task effortless! With a few simple clicks, you can access the element’s settings and change its appearance. If you’re new to the editor, take a look at our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">first steps tutorial</a>. Let’s start with the idea behind the project: what is its purpose? Whether you’re designing a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/customize-articles-with-single-post-templates/">Single Post Template</a> or creating a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/halloween-landing-page-newspaper-theme/">Landing Page</a>, the goal is to engage your audience in a meaningful way. That can be either done by adding a subscription box, disclosing methods of contacting the company, or even by linking social media accounts that boost your follower interaction.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Layout</h3>



<p>When you have the idea, and set up a goal and start creating the layout. If you are looking for inspiration, take a look at some of the websites you enjoy browsing through. Where is their search button? How does their header look? Are the posts crowded together or given ample space between?

<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Monochromatic-color-Scheme-for-Classic-blue-in-a-catchy-web-design.jpg" alt="Monochromatic color Scheme for Classic blue in a catchy web design" class="wp-image-12779" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Monochromatic-color-Scheme-for-Classic-blue-in-a-catchy-web-design.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Monochromatic-color-Scheme-for-Classic-blue-in-a-catchy-web-design-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Monochromatic-color-Scheme-for-Classic-blue-in-a-catchy-web-design-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Monochromatic-color-Scheme-for-Classic-blue-in-a-catchy-web-design-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Monochromatic-color-Scheme-for-Classic-blue-in-a-catchy-web-design-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Monochromatic-color-Scheme-for-Classic-blue-in-a-catchy-web-design-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h3>Style</h3>



<p>The next part is <a href="https://tagdiv.com/typography-guide-101-basics-tips-ideas-inspiration/">choosing fonts</a> and changing colors. To do this, click on an element to begin with and go to the “Style” tab. All the settings you need are here: text colors, backgrounds, shadows, and different borders. Change each one in a way that creates contrast. For example, if the palette chosen is a monochromatic one, you can have classic blue as the primary color of text and elements. In contrast, their background can be a pale sky blue. This can be switched up if you need for the next row to create balance and sections. The idea is to experiment with what looks good and appeals to you. Don’t forget to ask for feedback from coworkers, clients, or even the audience. A second opinion never hurts!</p>



<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>



<p>Pantone is a trendsetter in color decisions, and can positively impact your audience if you let it. Try incorporating classic blue while designing to add a touch of stability to an otherwise unstable environment. As a color of clarity and peace, let it inspire you in all of the projects you undertake.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with the previous years, 2020 comes with a whole new line of thinking for the visual arts. Where are we going now? How do we stand out? By answering these questions, we get to dive into a whole new era of graphic design and its popular tendencies. Find out how to take these design trends to the next level and incorporate them into your website or art.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>3D Elements &amp; Graphics</h2>



<p>Countering the past decade’s minimalist aesthetic, companies have begun using 3D elements and animations to better showcase their brand. Graphic designers, that have knowledge and experience using Maya, Blender, Zbrush, or Cinema 4D, are sought after nowadays. If you need help creating a 3D model, we advise you to either seek out help from a professional or check out these amazing tutorials from <a href="https://greyscalegorilla.com/tutorials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GreyScaleGorilla</a>. It’s never too late to learn something new!</p>



<p>Combining a 3D element with a 2-dimensional object or even typography, you get an innovative, fresh look to any design you create. Explore how to use colors to make everything pop by learning about <a href="https://tagdiv.com/color-theory-newspaper-theme/">Color Theory</a>.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Entice-customers-to-buy-your-product-using-thin-line-illustration.jpg" alt="Entice customers to buy your product using thin line illustrations" class="wp-image-11980" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Entice-customers-to-buy-your-product-using-thin-line-illustration.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Entice-customers-to-buy-your-product-using-thin-line-illustration-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Entice-customers-to-buy-your-product-using-thin-line-illustration-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Entice-customers-to-buy-your-product-using-thin-line-illustration-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Entice-customers-to-buy-your-product-using-thin-line-illustration-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Entice-customers-to-buy-your-product-using-thin-line-illustration-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Line Art</h2>



<p>As a new contender in the design trends industry, line art is about making things simple, direct. With illustrations taking over companies’ branding and media, the desire to make it even clearer is dominating. As such, by removing base colors, you get this new type of illustration &#8211; only forms, lines guiding you to read and discover more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can achieve this effect by opening either Photoshop or Illustrator, and taking the pen tool to create a scene with no fill, only strokes. The entire concept behind this new trend is to make everything seamless while keeping it abstract.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Make-postera-with-cyberpunk-colors-and-shapes.jpg" alt="Make a poster with cyberpunk colors and shapes" class="wp-image-11985" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Make-postera-with-cyberpunk-colors-and-shapes.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Make-postera-with-cyberpunk-colors-and-shapes-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Make-postera-with-cyberpunk-colors-and-shapes-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Make-postera-with-cyberpunk-colors-and-shapes-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Make-postera-with-cyberpunk-colors-and-shapes-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Make-postera-with-cyberpunk-colors-and-shapes-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Cyberpunk Color Schemes</h2>



<p>Previously, we’ve seen how <a href="https://tagdiv.com/gradients-in-web-design-newspaper-theme/">gradients </a>and bold colors have taken over the design industry so that companies and media stand out. In 2020, we can expect even more vibrancy coming from the visual arts, with bright neon colors mixed to give off a very retro yet futuristic look. </p>



<p>To achieve this, you would need to create a color palette that involves overly saturated colors while also keeping the contrast between them. This way, any text is visible and legible, ensuring a great reading experience. Mix and match to achieve the desired effect with <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adobe Color</a>. When you’ve decided on a scheme, just incorporate it into your website.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Create-a-stunning-impression-on-clients-with-quirky-font.jpg" alt="Create a stunning impression on clients with quirky fonts" class="wp-image-11979" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Create-a-stunning-impression-on-clients-with-quirky-font.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Create-a-stunning-impression-on-clients-with-quirky-font-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Create-a-stunning-impression-on-clients-with-quirky-font-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Create-a-stunning-impression-on-clients-with-quirky-font-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Create-a-stunning-impression-on-clients-with-quirky-font-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Create-a-stunning-impression-on-clients-with-quirky-font-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Typography Craze</h2>



<p>Experimenting with new fonts, dragging them, distorting them, and creating something brilliant is a graphic designer’s job. This year, we can already see this being taken to the extreme. The quirkier the font, the more use it will get.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get started, head on over to your favorite font website. You can take a look at <a href="https://www.dafont.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DaFont</a> if you don’t have one yet. Browse through the multiple categories from distorted, eroded, western, calligraphy, handwritten, and so many more. In the search bar, you can select the licensing you want, whether the project you’re working on is for educational purposes or commercial use. When you find the perfect font, read through its licensing agreement and check whether it applies to the type of project you want to use it for. No worries, most artists link to their website from which you can buy the font from if you’re unsure!&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Showcase-your-company-with-thin-lines-geometry-and-shape.jpg" alt="Showcase your company with thin lines geometry" class="wp-image-11984" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Showcase-your-company-with-thin-lines-geometry-and-shape.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Showcase-your-company-with-thin-lines-geometry-and-shape-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Showcase-your-company-with-thin-lines-geometry-and-shape-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Showcase-your-company-with-thin-lines-geometry-and-shape-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Showcase-your-company-with-thin-lines-geometry-and-shape-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Showcase-your-company-with-thin-lines-geometry-and-shape-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Thin Lines in Geometric Shapes</h2>



<p>We’ve seen how <a href="https://tagdiv.com/geometric-web-design-newspaper-theme/">geometrical design</a> has taken over the internet in the previous years. It still reigns supreme even now, just in a new form. Taking a grid and overlaying it on top of shapes to sculpt it and mesh it while removing the shape itself, you get a new trend. But how do you make this yourself? Open Illustrator and create the type of grid you want: thin strokes, small spacing in between each line. Now make a shape with the programs’ innate tools. Overlay the lines over the shape and choose merge. </p>



<p>Now you can add a background to the overall design, or even choose to drag the lines around using the Warp tool option. When it’s done, you can either export it as a .svg or to your library and choose to edit it even further in Photoshop.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Impress-your-business-associates-with-image-maskings.jpg" alt="Impress your business associates with image masking" class="wp-image-11978" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Impress-your-business-associates-with-image-maskings.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Impress-your-business-associates-with-image-maskings-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Impress-your-business-associates-with-image-maskings-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Impress-your-business-associates-with-image-maskings-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Impress-your-business-associates-with-image-maskings-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Impress-your-business-associates-with-image-maskings-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Image or Text Masking</h2>



<p>Double exposure in photography is the same as this effect. When you overlay one layer across another and link them so that it takes the shape of the one beneath, you get a basic example of masking. This creates a mysterious vibe to the overall image as it leaves much of it unrevealed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With your editor of choice opened, you can juxtapose two images on top of each other, an image over a text, or one over a brushstroke. Now, there are multiple ways to get this and the most accessible being to link the two together. However, you can also do this using the multiple blending modes your program offers, such as Lighten, Overlay, Multiply, and others. The last option would be to take the time to mask the image out. You would need to click on the mask option. While having it selected, begin chipping away at its edges using your brush, pencil, or lasso tool with a dark color.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Appeal-to-the-masses-with-a-vintage-look.jpg" alt="Appeal to the masses with a vintage look" class="wp-image-11954" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Appeal-to-the-masses-with-a-vintage-look.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Appeal-to-the-masses-with-a-vintage-look-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Appeal-to-the-masses-with-a-vintage-look-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Appeal-to-the-masses-with-a-vintage-look-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Appeal-to-the-masses-with-a-vintage-look-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Appeal-to-the-masses-with-a-vintage-look-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Retro or Vintage design</h2>



<p>You know the saying about how history repeats itself? Well, the ‘50s are back in style in graphic design with artists trying to evoke the earthy colors and the illustration aspects of those years with a modern outlook. Get inspired by taking a look at the <a href="https://www.barewalls.com/posters-art-prints/1950s.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warm earthy tones</a> the posters from back then used to look like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Create a color scheme that evokes the feeling of these fantastic designs and wow the crowd. If you’re working on an illustration, add a grain texture on top of your finished work to give it a sandy retro feel.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>Whether you choose to adopt any of these new styles into your art, project, or website is up to you. As media is always ever-evolving, trends can come and go, which is why the vintage and retro design is now widespread. To amaze people with a fantastic design takes more than just following the trends: your brand needs to be something your audience can relate to and enjoy. <a href="https://tagdiv.com/differences-between-user-experience-and-user-interface/">Useful UI</a> is just as impressive as stylish images. If done right, it can be even more impressive. So before you do a complete redesign, try to prioritize your user’s experience. And when you’re up for it, use this list as a source of inspiration. </p>

As a bright, innocent color, pink may be what you need for any product or design. But how do you use it to create something stunning, and what colors go well with it? Explore all that pink has to offer and its hidden meanings throughout history.</p>



<h2>Pink Color Meanings</h2>



<p>A tint of red that appears when you mix red with white, pink is the color of youth, love, friendship, and charm. You can create lighter shades of pink&nbsp; by adding more white, while darker shades of the color can be achieved by adding more black.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border td-caption-align-https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Complementary-Color-Scheme-Pink.jpg" style="max-width:none;width:1198px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Complementary-Color-Scheme-Pink.jpg" alt="A Complementary Palette for a blogging site" class="wp-image-10483" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Complementary-Color-Scheme-Pink.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Complementary-Color-Scheme-Pink-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Complementary-Color-Scheme-Pink-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Complementary-Color-Scheme-Pink-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Complementary-Color-Scheme-Pink-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Complementary-Color-Scheme-Pink-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>This hue represents sweetness, playfulness, and romance. Often associated with feminine products or ideas, pink has multiple meanings behind it. Moreover, this ties closely with its shade:</p>



<ul><li>The more violet the pink is, the more likely it is to be associated with interior design and even wedding motifs. A color such as pink lavender is perfect for cosmetics, too.</li><li>When the shade of pink has orange tints to it, you get colors like coral pink, peach pink, and even apricot blush.

<h2>Pink Color Schemes</h2>



<p>Whether your product is designed for children or adults, you may need to rethink the colors used for it. Head on over to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://color.adobe.com/create" target="_blank">Adobe CC</a> for the first look at pink’s color schemes. Choose the primary color by dragging the circles in the color wheel to pick. From the left side panel, click on any color scheme to see the options. If you’re new to what color schemes are, head on over to <a href="https://tagdiv.com/color-theory-newspaper-theme/">Color Theory</a> to find out.</p>



<ul><li>A pink <strong>monochromatic</strong> scheme uses darker and lighter shades of the color. If part of your design’s color already includes pink, it’s easy to add different shades of it to create a stunning result.</li><li>Pink’s <strong>analogous</strong> palette makes use of its close by color neighbors: violet, purple, and orange. Depending on the shade of your primary color, this can either be a pastel, preppy beginning, or with a dark shade of pink, a luxurious one.</li><li>The <strong>complementary</strong> color to pink is lime green, a green that’s close to yellow. These two hues are closely tied together in nature, so it gives a natural feeling.</li><li>Pink’s <strong>split complementary</strong> is lime green and yellow. With these two shades, your design should then be associated with liveliness and high-energy.</li><li>A <strong>triadic</strong> scheme for pink would be yellow-orange and turquoise or teal. This is a trendy color palette for modern designs. It’s highly versatile and can be used for almost<strong> any media.</strong></li></ul>

<h2>Go pink!</h2>



<p>No matter what you’re designing, you can easily incorporate pink into it if it aligns with your core message. In fact, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/fashion-and-style/11216266/Are-you-man-enough-to-wear-pink.html" target="_blank">The Telegraph</a>, your product doesn’t even need to be intended for a female audience, as pink used to be associated with masculinity. It was only in the 1950s that it became the centerpiece color for femininity. </p>



<p>So, if you’re designing a clothesline for men, use nude pinks as the primary color for it. Choose one of the color schemes above for a great start. However, don’t go overboard with the number of colors. </p>



<p>For website design, apply pink as either the backdrop, an accent color, or douse your entire site in this youthful, charming hue! How would you do that? The answer to that depends on how the website was built. If you use Newspaper Theme, open any page with the tagDiv Composer, the frontend page builder. Drag-and-drop elements, arrange them, create the perfect layout, and then from the “Style” tab of each element, choose colors.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Pink as a backdrop</h3>



<p>On any row of the page, open the “CSS” tab. Choose pink as the background color and then drag elements into the row. For buttons or hover effects, go with one of your other chosen shades from the color palette. This makes the pink fade in comparison to the content and act more like a curtain guiding the audience through the page.</p>



<h3>Pink as an accent</h3>



<p>If you want to use pink sparingly, add it on items that you want to highlight. Such as a background for a button, or even a link’s color. This makes those elements stand out from the rest and helps guide your audience along.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-caption-align-https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/All-Pink-Monochromatic-Scheme.jpg" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/All-Pink-Monochromatic-Scheme.jpg" alt="A monochromatic Scheme for a Beauty Website" class="wp-image-10484" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/All-Pink-Monochromatic-Scheme.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/All-Pink-Monochromatic-Scheme-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/All-Pink-Monochromatic-Scheme-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/All-Pink-Monochromatic-Scheme-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/All-Pink-Monochromatic-Scheme-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/All-Pink-Monochromatic-Scheme-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h3>Pink, pink, pink, everywhere pink</h3>



<p>If you’re a pink lover and you want the world to know it, you can always turn the entire website pink with Newspaper Theme. From background colors to fonts, image blending modes, use either an analogous or monochromatic scheme and go wild!</p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>Whether your intended product is designed for a male or female audience, don’t let it deter you from using this highly vibrant and sweet color. Pink is the perfect choice no matter the project as long as you choose an appropriate shade of it and color scheme. Don’t let social standards dictate how you should use colors, and have fun! </p>

<p> Can you effortlessly incorporate blue into any design? Discover the perfect color palette for your brand. Whether you’re promoting a product or coming up with a design sketch, use it to invoke the core message through the color’s meanings.</p>



<h2>The Meanings behind Blue</h2>



<p>Intuitive and loyal, blue represents your intuition, open spaces, freedom, and sensitivity. It is often associated with cold and has a calming effect on the human body. Too much blue can dampen the mood.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border td-caption-align-https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Corporate-Website-with-Blues.jpg" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="568" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Corporate-Website-with-Blues.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10326" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Corporate-Website-with-Blues.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Corporate-Website-with-Blues-300x142.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Corporate-Website-with-Blues-1024x485.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Corporate-Website-with-Blues-768x364.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Corporate-Website-with-Blues-696x329.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Corporate-Website-with-Blues-1068x506.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>Its significant use in military garments, or even in the corporate media, makes blue an intelligent, trustworthy color. Depending on the shade of blue you use, it can have different meanings:</p>



<ul><li>Violet Blues are feminine and pretty. They can easily be used in creating feminine products or even in association with something fragile and pure.</li><li>Green Blues, such as turquoise or aqua, invoke the essence of water. They’re a lot more energetic, so they can easily be used for environmental projects or even sci-fi media.</li><li>Gray Blues, like the color of denim, are versatile and peaceful. Since they’re flexible, they can be used in almost any product design or for any other purposes.</li><li>Pure Blues are sincere and soothing. They can be bright and eye-catching or even serious and somber.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Color Palettes for Blue</h2>



<p>After exploring all the different meanings behind different hues of <a href="https://tagdiv.com/classic-blue-newspaper-theme-color-year/">blue</a>, you can now choose it as the primary color for your project.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a single focused purpose, a landing page is what your visitors land on when they click an ad, offer, or call to action button. Each season comes with its trends and marketing opportunities. October is the spookiest month of the year. With Halloween coming up, most brands stir from their standard business path and approach the audience differently. Introduce the users to your offers, site, or blog with a Newspaper Theme seasonal landing page that captures their attention and turns them into a client.</p>
<h2>Why a landing page?</h2>
<p>An ad click is a split-second decision from the audience. Make it personal and relatable enough that from visitors, they become consumers. With a customized landing page, you do just that. No matter the purpose or intention with the landing page, help your readers discover precisely what they need.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_9495" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9495" style="width: 267px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cosmic-Ventures-Construction-Company-Halloween-Landing-Page.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="td-modal-image wp-image-9495 size-medium" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cosmic-Ventures-Construction-Company-Halloween-Landing-Page-267x300.jpg" alt="Cosmic Ventures Construction Company Halloween Landing Page" width="267" height="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cosmic-Ventures-Construction-Company-Halloween-Landing-Page-267x300.jpg 267w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cosmic-Ventures-Construction-Company-Halloween-Landing-Page-768x862.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cosmic-Ventures-Construction-Company-Halloween-Landing-Page-912x1024.jpg 912w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cosmic-Ventures-Construction-Company-Halloween-Landing-Page-696x781.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cosmic-Ventures-Construction-Company-Halloween-Landing-Page-1068x1199.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cosmic-Ventures-Construction-Company-Halloween-Landing-Page-374x420.jpg 374w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cosmic-Ventures-Construction-Company-Halloween-Landing-Page.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9495" class="wp-caption-text">Click to see fullscreen.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The visitor, upon hearing or reading a promotional offer, trusts your website to deliver on the promises it makes. The landing page is where you make a special offer, a trade, deal, or exchange of information in return for their contact details. Done just right, the potential is vast:</p>
<ul>
<li>A boost in traffic for your website</li>
<li>Increased sales</li>
<li>Growth in conversion</li>
</ul>
<p>Newspaper Theme makes it easy to create an eye-catching landing page that will hook each user in.</p>
<h2>Let the spooks rise!</h2>
<p>Halloween’s just around the corner, with its increasing and ever-growing popularity globally, it is just the right time to spruce things up. Popular brands such as Ford, Oreo, LG have released Halloween campaigns that stuck with the audience for years to come. After all, sometimes, the best way to lure new users in is to give them an original seasonal campaign.</p>
<p>Shine above the competition with a spooky or cute Halloween landing page. Easily show visitors that you can adapt to suit their needs. Before you start, however, do your keyword research. What is the topmost searched for words or queries? Use <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Trends</a> as a helpful tool.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-9507 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Halloween-Contact-Form.jpg" alt="Halloween Contact Form" width="1200" height="506" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Halloween-Contact-Form.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Halloween-Contact-Form-300x127.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Halloween-Contact-Form-768x324.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Halloween-Contact-Form-1024x432.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Halloween-Contact-Form-696x293.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Halloween-Contact-Form-1068x450.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Halloween-Contact-Form-996x420.jpg 996w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Be relevant and personal</h2>
<p>Whether you choose to be different from your usual website’s style or maintain some form of uniformity with this landing page, know the target audience. After all, people care about getting a solution to their problem, so market it accordingly. If you have a news website, create a Halloween landing page to promote your newsletter and bring more readers in.</p>
<p>The tricky part of designing a seasonal campaign is to create something relevant to your product while keeping the holiday spirit. Take inspiration from popular brands such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>LG chose to show the realistic display of its technology through an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeXMxuNNlE8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elevator prank</a></li>
<li>The Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation jumped on the seasonal campaign with a scary but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApmPQDAzYyM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">informative video</a> regarding first aid in case of stroke</li>
<li>M&amp;M’s went viral with an <a href="https://twitter.com/mmschocolate/status/920293664848523265" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram interactive story</a> that urged their audience to decide the faith of its protagonist</li>
<li>The Best Dog Day Ever event chose a cute <a href="https://www.bestdogdayever.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-page layout</a> to show their event’s details</li>
</ul>
<p>Look for something that fits your brand.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-9506 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/example-of-halloween-newsletter-form.jpg" alt="A Halloween Newsletter Form" width="1200" height="400" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/example-of-halloween-newsletter-form.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/example-of-halloween-newsletter-form-300x100.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/example-of-halloween-newsletter-form-768x256.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/example-of-halloween-newsletter-form-1024x341.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/example-of-halloween-newsletter-form-696x232.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/example-of-halloween-newsletter-form-1068x356.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Halloween landing page with Newspaper Theme</h2>
<p>With inspiration in mind and a goal set, you’re ready to create the perfect seasonal campaign! Browse through your favorite stock website and choose images that are going to fit perfectly with your idea. Whether it be jack-o-lanterns, spooky scary skeletons, ghosts, witches, zombies, bats, vampires, choose something that fits with the theme.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_9494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9494" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Hunting-Trail-Event-on-Halloween.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="td-modal-image wp-image-9494 size-medium" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Hunting-Trail-Event-on-Halloween-300x300.jpg" alt="The Hunting Trail Event on Halloween" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Hunting-Trail-Event-on-Halloween-300x300.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Hunting-Trail-Event-on-Halloween-150x150.jpg 150w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Hunting-Trail-Event-on-Halloween-768x768.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Hunting-Trail-Event-on-Halloween-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Hunting-Trail-Event-on-Halloween-696x696.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Hunting-Trail-Event-on-Halloween-1068x1068.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Hunting-Trail-Event-on-Halloween-420x420.jpg 420w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Hunting-Trail-Event-on-Halloween.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9494" class="wp-caption-text">Click to see fullscreen.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Open the tagDiv Composer, our front-end page builder, on a new page. Create a simple Header that allows the user to see the logo and your most essential site links:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Homepage</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>About</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re going for a full-screen background, <a href="https://tagdiv.com/overlay-header-newspaper-theme/">make an Overlay Header</a> to lay on top of the background image. Make a full-screen background by going into the CSS tab of the row’s settings and uploading your photo. Then choose from the General tab the “Stretch row and content” from the drop-down menu.</p>
<h2>Content ghosts</h2>
<p>Add a Column Title and an Inline Text element to describe the landing page’s purpose. Invite them to further explore the page by creating a second-row beneath dividing it into two columns. On one of the columns, add an image, and on the other, write a message to convince people why your website is right for them.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a news website, tell them that it always delivers the most accurate reports and it’s always up to date. Convince them through a real and <a href="https://tagdiv.com/six-copywriting-tips-for-engaging-content/">genuine argument</a>. Showcase this through a Flex Block, displaying your latest articles and news posts.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_9493" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9493" style="width: 265px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lively-News-find-out-more-about-this-news-website.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" td-modal-image wp-image-9493 size-medium" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lively-News-find-out-more-about-this-news-website-265x300.jpg" alt="Lively News find out more about this news website" width="265" height="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lively-News-find-out-more-about-this-news-website-265x300.jpg 265w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lively-News-find-out-more-about-this-news-website-768x868.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lively-News-find-out-more-about-this-news-website-906x1024.jpg 906w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lively-News-find-out-more-about-this-news-website-696x786.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lively-News-find-out-more-about-this-news-website-1068x1207.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lively-News-find-out-more-about-this-news-website-372x420.jpg 372w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lively-News-find-out-more-about-this-news-website.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9493" class="wp-caption-text">Click to see fullscreen.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Add more spooky elements to the page through the Image element. Adjust the padding and margin to the item so that it appears next to an element as a ghost. Try to include references in your text to the Halloween customs and its associations. However, make it blend in seamlessly with the rest of your message. Drag and drop buttons into the layout to create beautiful call-to-actions and urge the visitors to convert. The last step is to change the fonts and colors of each element to fit in with the theme. Browse through the available fonts from Newspaper Theme, create a beautiful color palette, or get inspired by the Halloween ones offered by <a href="https://color.adobe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe CC</a>. It’s easy! Just type out the term <b>Halloween </b>and browse through user and author made color schemes that have a HEX code you can copy straight onto your website.</p>
<h2>Boo your inner critic away</h2>
<p>With a great idea in mind, you can achieve anything. Don’t let your inner critic get the better of you. <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newspaper Theme</a>’s easy drag-and-drop front-end page builder helps to create any layout desired for any page. Blend everything seamlessly with the Style tab settings. It’s the month where everything ghostly and dreary rises and haunts the earth, so why not celebrate it along with your followers? Remember that a well-made seasonal campaign’s purpose is to convert readers into consumers and also to make your brand appear relatable. So, start editing, start creating, start designing!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What makes<span style="background-color: #ff6f61; color: #ffffff;"> Living Coral </span>Pantone’s Color of the Year? A vibrant hue situated between orange and pink, the color is now present in both traditional and online design. Ever popular, it grew as a joyful and optimistic color that can easily be present in everyday life. Learn more about its origins and how to integrate it into your website’s design, below.</p>
<p><a href="https://tagdiv.com/duotone-web-design-newspaper-theme/"><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-9358 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Duotone-design.jpg" alt="Duotone design" width="1200" height="500" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Duotone-design.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Duotone-design-300x125.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Duotone-design-768x320.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Duotone-design-1024x427.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Duotone-design-696x290.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Duotone-design-1068x445.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Duotone-design-1008x420.jpg 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<h2>The Origins of Living Coral</h2>
<p>A deep dive into the ocean, you might find coral reefs and therefore the color we’re speaking of in its natural habitat. This would be one of the instances in which you would find Living Coral in the real world, but it’s not the only one. Its presence can be noted in history through its depiction as <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-history-living-coral-pantones-color-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“warding off evil</a>.” Coral has been fairly often portrayed in Renaissance and Victorian eras through paintings. The color has always been there as a mix of pink and orange, in sunsets and sunrises.</p>
<p>While at first sight, Living Coral may appear as an exotic hue, it can embody friendliness, openness, revitalization. The continued increase in global warming, the ocean’s reefs have been slowly dying. As a call to raise awareness for the <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coral_bleach.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dying corals</a>, this is <a href="https://store.pantone.com/uk/en/color-of-the-year-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pantone’s way</a> of emphasizing a growing issue in today’s world.</p>
<h2>Why should you include it on your website?</h2>
<p>Capture the eyes of all the viewers with this fun and charming color. It includes the happiness of orange and the playfulness of pink. Use it on call-to-actions to attract and invite users to interact further with your website. Are you looking to redesign a website, attract more visitors, or launch a new product? Add a popular color to any design scheme to boost your traffic.</p>
<p>Living Coral could be the statement piece you need to entice users into buying products or becoming a subscriber to an online blog.</p>
<p><a href="https://tagdiv.com/overlay-header-newspaper-theme/"><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-9359 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Header-with-Living-Coral.jpg" alt="Header with Living Coral" width="1200" height="770" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Header-with-Living-Coral.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Header-with-Living-Coral-300x193.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Header-with-Living-Coral-768x493.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Header-with-Living-Coral-1024x657.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Header-with-Living-Coral-696x447.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Header-with-Living-Coral-1068x685.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Header-with-Living-Coral-655x420.jpg 655w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<h2>Color Schemes &amp; Plans</h2>
<p>If you want this tint on your website, you need a plan, and also a color scheme. The best partner to Living Coral is Teal, a medium bluish-green color. Use them together to complement each other perfectly. A fantastic online tool that can help you find other hues that go well together is<a href="https://color.adobe.com/create" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Adobe Color</a>.</p>
<p>The hex code for Living Coral is <span style="background-color: #ff6f61; color: #ffffff;">#FF6F61</span>, so copy and paste this into the middle rectangle, and you’re good to go. Explore the color schemes by clicking on the settings on the left.

You can also take inspiration by looking into the different color palettes that others have created in the “Trends” tab of Adobe Color. Just type Living Coral into the search bar, and you’ll get dozens of different schemes.</p>
<p>Now, whichever option you use, pick the primary and accent colors of your page or element. With this in mind, we can move on to designing the page.</p>
<h2>To Coral or not to Coral?</h2>
<p>Open a page you would like to retouch with the tagDiv Composer page builder. With the color scheme chosen in mind, pick the hues for each element accordingly &#8211; from buttons to text, icons, and background. Pay attention to the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/color-theory-newspaper-theme/">contrast you’re creating</a> so that each element is easily noticeable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When all rules get broken, you get Digital Brutalism. With an asymmetrical layout, no visual hierarchy, and a fight for attention between the elements on the page, it certainly stands out. As a design trend that has its origins on the architectural movement from the 1950s, the “no holds barred” attitude of Digital Brutalism makes each site unique. In a realm where anarchy reigns, how does User Experience hold up? Before we explore that question, let’s start at the beginning.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-9290 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pixelated-images-clashing-colors-and-asymmetry2.jpg" alt="pixelated images, clashing colors and asymmetry" width="1200" height="500" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pixelated-images-clashing-colors-and-asymmetry2.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pixelated-images-clashing-colors-and-asymmetry2-300x125.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pixelated-images-clashing-colors-and-asymmetry2-768x320.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pixelated-images-clashing-colors-and-asymmetry2-1024x427.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pixelated-images-clashing-colors-and-asymmetry2-696x290.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pixelated-images-clashing-colors-and-asymmetry2-1068x445.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pixelated-images-clashing-colors-and-asymmetry2-1008x420.jpg 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>What is Digital Brutalism?</h2>
<p>Back in the 1950s, right after World War II, a new architectural movement broke out as a counter to the overly ornate style of the previous years. Buildings were crafted out of solid concrete and were left bare, with no drops of color. A stark contrast, they stood out for looking comfortable or relaxed.</p>
<p>How does this come into play nowadays? The lack of structure and rules has always been present in the media and culture. So now we witness it in a new Design trend called Digital Brutalism. A movement which, according to Pascal Deville, “can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of today’s web design.”</p>
<p>While exploring any brutalist website, you may start to notice patterns. Surely the one distinctive thing about it is the nostalgia. Let’s go back to the early days of the internet when anyone could make a website. Not everyone who had a website back then knew what they wanted to achieve with it or how to get their core message across. You’d come across things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cluttered design, with elements overlapping one another.</li>
<li>Items that would appear clickable weren’t.</li>
<li>Clashing colors between various blocks or text.</li>
<li>No visual hierarchy.</li>
<li>Use of pixelated images, multitude of fonts, animated gifs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples may be seen as a faux pas now, but they’ve started popping up again as a throwback to the early days of the internet in this new trend.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-9289 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Flexible-Big-Grid-and-column-background-image2.jpg" alt="Flexible Big Grid and column background image" width="1200" height="500" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Flexible-Big-Grid-and-column-background-image2.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Flexible-Big-Grid-and-column-background-image2-300x125.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Flexible-Big-Grid-and-column-background-image2-768x320.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Flexible-Big-Grid-and-column-background-image2-1024x427.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Flexible-Big-Grid-and-column-background-image2-696x290.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Flexible-Big-Grid-and-column-background-image2-1068x445.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Flexible-Big-Grid-and-column-background-image2-1008x420.jpg 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Why would you build a website like that?</h2>
<p>If each website is keeping the same design: a link is a link, buttons are easily distinguishable, there is no clash of colors. Then everything becomes a copy of a copy of a copy. Now how do you break free of that? By abolishing all rules. That’s where Digital Brutalism comes in.</p>
<p>User Experience is important. Anybody wants a site that can be easily navigable. However, when it costs your brand identity to build one, you may need to rethink some design choices. If you search through the vast web, notice that not all sites are user-friendly. This doesn’t have to be the case for you.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some popular Brutalist websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://craigslist.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Craigslist</a> has kept the same look since it was built. It is still used to this day even with the simple layout and its quirks. Its plain in your face design, however, has probably been the reason why it’s still popular to this day.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> has experimented with Digital Brutalism while still retaining its easily navigable features. Take a look at their <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-yahoo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo! Article</a>, while it does not align with their other articles, it stands out and grabs your attention.</li>
<li><a href="https://theoutline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outline</a> shines through with its appearance. There’s an abundance of color, fonts intermingled together, elements that give the website a unique look.</li>
<li>Have you seen <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropbox</a>’s new design? While the elements are still accessible to users, the colors and photos are different and make it novel.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.balenciaga.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balenciaga</a> has always been a rule breaker. When announcing new products or preparing for an event, their website’s design changes and gets funkier. Even if it may seem overwhelming, it’s been highly successful.</li>
</ul>
<p>What can you take out of this? There’s no need to sacrifice UX for fantastic design, and if you want to make a striking site: you need to go against the flow.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-9292 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Complementary-colors-used-in-an-asymmetrical-layout2.jpg" alt="Complementary colors used in an asymmetrical layout" width="1200" height="700" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Complementary-colors-used-in-an-asymmetrical-layout2.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Complementary-colors-used-in-an-asymmetrical-layout2-300x175.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Complementary-colors-used-in-an-asymmetrical-layout2-768x448.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Complementary-colors-used-in-an-asymmetrical-layout2-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Complementary-colors-used-in-an-asymmetrical-layout2-696x406.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Complementary-colors-used-in-an-asymmetrical-layout2-1068x623.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Complementary-colors-used-in-an-asymmetrical-layout2-720x420.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Build a Brutalist website with Newspaper Theme</h2>
<p>The first step would be to get inspired. Take a look through any brutalist website that appeals to you. What exactly do you like about it? The color scheme, fonts, layout? Then try to implement it straight on your site with the tagDiv Composer page builder. Whichever answer, keep in mind that you still need to have a user-friendly website. Don’t go overboard with the rule-breaking.</p>
<h3><b>Color</b> me surprised</h3>
<p>If you want to catch the audience’s eye with the abundance of colors used, then go to the CSS tab on a row and add color to the background. Why don’t you change the color of the Logo and text to a contrasting or <a href="https://tagdiv.com/color-theory-newspaper-theme/">complementary one</a>? On the next row, the background color should be different than any of the previously used ones. So, for example, if you used blue and yellow before, use red or green for the background now.</p>
<p>Keep the same scheme up throughout the page while still adhering to the rules of <a href="https://tagdiv.com/color-theory-newspaper-theme/">Color Theory</a>. So you can obtain a unique design for your website.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-9291 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Various-fonts-on-a-flex-Block2.jpg" alt="Various fonts on a flex Block" width="1200" height="445" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Various-fonts-on-a-flex-Block2.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Various-fonts-on-a-flex-Block2-300x111.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Various-fonts-on-a-flex-Block2-768x285.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Various-fonts-on-a-flex-Block2-1024x380.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Various-fonts-on-a-flex-Block2-696x258.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Various-fonts-on-a-flex-Block2-1068x396.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Various-fonts-on-a-flex-Block2-1133x420.jpg 1133w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Let’s <b>Open</b> the <b>Type</b></h3>
<p>Do you want to be remembered for your choice in fonts? Change the title’s typeface to <a href="https://tagdiv.com/bold-fonts-design-newspaper-theme/">something bold, big,</a> or even a Display font. Choose a different font for the subtitle and another one for the content. The <a href="https://tagdiv.com/typography-guide-101-basics-tips-ideas-inspiration/">contrast between each different font</a> is undoubtedly going to make the page distinctive. However, to keep the layout as straightforward and appealing as possible, go for a white or black background and text color so the focus can stay on the content.</p>
<p>No matter what elements you need: Newsletter box, Buttons, Single Images, Flex Blocks, Flexible Big Grids, try to vary the fonts used. So they’re never where anybody expects them. For example, if you used Fugaz One for the title, use it on the subtitle for the next element. You’ll quickly wow your crowd while keeping the users happy by sticking to a visual hierarchy.</p>
<h3>May we <b>lay </b>these <b>out</b>?</h3>
<p>If you want to respect Typography rules and Color Theory, break the boundaries with your design. How do you do that? Go for an asymmetry. Keep each element on the page very far apart from the other by creating white space. Take inspiration from <a href="https://techstylefashiongroup.com/">TechStyleFashionGroup</a>. Their grid-breaking layout shines. There’s no abundance of fonts or colors. Everything kept to a minimum to draw attention to the positioning of each element on the page.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-9293 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Asymmetrical-Header-Layout-with-background-images2.jpg" alt="Asymmetrical Header Layout with background images" width="1200" height="500" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Asymmetrical-Header-Layout-with-background-images2.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Asymmetrical-Header-Layout-with-background-images2-300x125.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Asymmetrical-Header-Layout-with-background-images2-768x320.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Asymmetrical-Header-Layout-with-background-images2-1024x427.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Asymmetrical-Header-Layout-with-background-images2-696x290.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Asymmetrical-Header-Layout-with-background-images2-1068x445.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Asymmetrical-Header-Layout-with-background-images2-1008x420.jpg 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>With tagDiv Composer open, add the necessary elements on your page and then create white space between them by increasing the padding or margins between them. You can either do this in the CSS tab or through the General Settings. For example, on the CSS tab of the row, add a lot of space top and bottom. Now add a Flex Block into the row. From the layout tab, modify the Module Padding to create space. Float the featured image to the left, change its width to 50% and then add padding to the Meta Info.</p>
<p>Each time you make changes, look to your favorite website, and get inspired by it. This way, you can achieve something that not only appeals to you but to the audience, too.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>While Digital Brutalism may seem flawed from a distance, with all its rule-bending styles, there’s something to take out of it. To stand out in an online environment where design rules are so easily accessible, you need to break loose from some boundaries. Keep your website unique, but also user-friendly with <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newspaper Theme</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to choose the colors for a website when you start the design process? Take into account their vibrancy, contrast, and the harmony between them. Picking the right colors that complement one another is part of the world of color theory, and through it, you can influence the website visitors’ emotions. So, what sort of impression do you want to create for your audience?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-8334 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Monochromatic-color-scheme-color-theory.jpg" alt="Monochrome Web Design Example in Newspaper WordPress Theme" width="1200" height="658" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Monochromatic-color-scheme-color-theory.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Monochromatic-color-scheme-color-theory-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Monochromatic-color-scheme-color-theory-768x421.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Monochromatic-color-scheme-color-theory-1024x561.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Monochromatic-color-scheme-color-theory-696x382.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Monochromatic-color-scheme-color-theory-1068x586.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Monochromatic-color-scheme-color-theory-766x420.jpg 766w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Color 101: Basics</h2>
<p>When we talk about colors, we mostly refer to them based on their contrast, vibrancy, and relationship to each other. How does each one come into play? It’s easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>You create contrast by choosing two different hues for the background and text. It divides elements on a page and focuses the users’ attention naturally. It also makes the text more readable if done right. The best rule of thumb when choosing colors for your text and background is to have one of them be a very light color compared to the other.</li>
<li>Vibrancy refers to the level of color saturation. Brighter colors create energy, whereas pale ones help users relax.</li>
<li>If two colors clash, they do not complement each other and the results are not harmonious. There are multiple schemes for choosing a pair of colors that works well together from analogous, monochromatic, complementary, split complementary, and triadic.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a harmonious website, keep control of the contrast, vibrancy, and choose colors that go well together. It’s also essential to minimize the number of hues used, so at most, choose four, at best, choose two: a primary color and an accent one.</p>
<h2>How do you choose the perfect primary color?</h2>
<p>What do you want the users to feel or think when they first click on your website? Moreover, what is the core message you want to transmit to the visitors? For example, if you to appear professional and businesslike to the audience, you would need to showcase that through the primary color. The same goes for each industry.</p>

<h2>Color Harmony</h2>
<p>Have you chosen your website’s primary tint? If you want to know what color to pair it up with, there is a great website that can help with the decision. Head on over to <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create">Adobe CC</a> to have your first taste of the numerous color combinations available. However, if the color wheel does not help you decide, here&#8217;s an explanation for the color schemes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Monochromatic</b> color schemes focus on one hue only and different shades of it. For example, multiple shades of blue such as a dark blue, bright blue, and pale blue.</li>
<li><b>Analogous</b> refers to the neighbors of a single shade on the color wheel. If we stick to the previous example of blue, the analogous scheme for blue would be turquoise and purple.</li>
<li><b>Complementary</b> are the colors that appear on opposite sides of the spectrum. Blue’s complementary hue is yellow-orange.<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-8316 alignright" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/color-wheel1.png" alt="" width="250" height="250" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/color-wheel1.png 250w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/color-wheel1-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></li>
<li><b>Split Complementary</b> is adding an adjacent color to the complementary color. If blue is your primary, the split complementary to it are yellow and yellow-orange.</li>
<li><b>Triadic</b> uses a triangle scheme to choose the colors. Draw a triangle on your color wheel where one of the points touches the primary, and the other ends are your accent colors. For blue, the triadic scheme would be green and orange.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Color Theory with Newspaper Theme</h2>
<p>With the best possible color scheme in mind, it’s time to start building your website. Whether you import one of <a href="https://tagdiv.com/whats-new-in-newspaper-theme-10-3-2-update/">Newspaper Theme’s demos</a> straight to the site or create the entire website from the ground up from zero, you should always start with the logo.</p>
<p>Within the Header Builder, click or add the “Header Logo” element. From the Style tab, choose the primary hue for the text &amp; tagline. Now, switch to your accent color for the hover.

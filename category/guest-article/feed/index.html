										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has become common knowledge in the world of eCommerce that a conversion-centric design can make all the difference. If your product sells well in regular stores, but you have trouble selling it online, then there is a strong chance that something is wrong with your website or, more precisely, its design. Web design plays a crucial role in online sales, as it is directly responsible for quality user experience, the visibility of your website, accessibility and, of course, conversion.</p>
<p>One of the core aspects of a successful conversion is a positive first impression, and that is achieved with an aesthetically pleasing website. It’s pretty simple – the audience that browses your content for 15 minutes would rather look at something with a high aesthetic value than reading a plain text. To put this claim into perspective, <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/creative/files/2015/12/Adobe-State-of-Content-Report.pdf">38% of people will most likely leave</a> your website, simply because they do not like the layout, in other words, you lose a large number of leads right from the get-go.</p>
<p>Here we will discuss some of the most popular design tactics that can help you increase the conversion rate on your website.</p>
<h3>1. Hick’s Law</h3>
<p>The more choices you leave to a user, the bigger the chance they will forgo making any kind of decision. Hick&#8217;s Law helps us establish a balance and ensure that we don&#8217;t scare off our traffic by spamming them with too many choices.</p>
<p>The law is named after psychologist William Edmund Hick, and it explains how that time for making a decision increases proportionally to the number of possible choices. So, according to this theory, if you present users with more choices, the time for a successful conversion will also increase.</p>
<p>Psychologists Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper tested this theory in an <a href="https://hbr.org/2006/06/more-isnt-always-better">experiment</a>. They presented two different tables with varieties of jam, one simple with only 6 varieties of jam, and other with 24 different products. Only one-tenth of buyers went for the table with more choices, and the other 90 percent of buyers all purchased from the simple table.</p>
<h3>2. Skeleton Screens</h3>
<p>Skeleton screens are a great way to improve the overall load time of your pages and therefore reduce the bounce rate, which is one of the key elements of a good conversion. Loading screens can be annoying, and since things do not run smoothly 24/7, there is a strong chance that a portion of online shoppers will experience a delay in loading speed. In order to mitigate the bounce rate caused by the lingering loading display, you can do this simple design trick that can persuade users everything is still running fine.</p>
<p>Even though you do not speed up the loading speed itself, your page will start <a href="https://medium.com/ux-for-india/facilitating-better-interactions-using-skeleton-screens-a034a51120a5">displaying the skeleton of the content</a>, which gives the impression of a more functional site, and that everything will be available in just a second.</p>
<h3>3. Animated Call-to-Action Buttons</h3>
<p>CTA buttons that are well-designed and well-placed can increase conversion. The latest trend is specially designed, animated CTA buttons which do not take away too much from the overall page but attract just enough attention to provoke a reaction. So, in addition to deciding on the size and placement of the button, take some time to think of a tasteful animation that corresponds to the style of your website. We have already stated how visual appeal plays an important role in the conversion process, and animated call-to-action buttons are just an extension of that statement.</p>
<h3>4. Use Negative Space</h3>
<p>Everything that isn&#8217;t an element of the page design, in other words, all the blank page space, is considered negative space. Despite the simplicity of the definition, negative space is one of the most important design elements at our disposal, since it ensures visibility and clarity of information, which is the key to a good conversion.</p>
<p>The right use of negative space can focus the attention on call-to-action buttons and increase on-page engagement. Here is an example of a website that uses negative space splendidly – <a href="https://flat.io/">Flat.io</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image-io-for-marco.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-807 aligncenter" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image-io-for-marco.png" alt="" width="620" height="506" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image-io-for-marco.png 620w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image-io-for-marco-300x245.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image-io-for-marco-515x420.png 515w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, their main objective is to make the visitors sign up with Facebook or Google, and the entire homepage is designed around this incentive.</p>
<h3>5. K.I.S.S. (Keep it Simple Stupid)</h3>
<p>It is important to keep in mind the original purpose of the website that you are designing, and not <a href="https://www.mhthemes.com/blog/why-sliders-are-not-great/">overcomplicate the design with unnecessary clutter</a> that serves no purpose. If there is one thing that was made pretty evident throughout the article, it&#8217;s that simplicity is an efficient tool for conversion.</p>
<p>First of all, it takes longer for people to process what they are seeing if there is more information crammed into one page, which is what Hick’s law has verified. Second, the whole point of skeleton screens is to mitigate the impression of an unresponsive website, which can occur due to a lot of unnecessary on-page elements in the first place. In other words, do not make your site too flashy, as it only backfires in the majority of cases.</p>
<h3>6. Gestalt Similarity Principle</h3>
<p>Good individual elements do not make a good unified design. The human eye tends to group similar elements together and, through that, identify their function. The Gestalt similarity principle allows us to leverage this to increase conversion. <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-law-of-similarity-gestalt-principles-1">Gestalt design principles</a> can be easily implemented during web design in numerous ways.</p>
<p>All you need to do is group the items you want to be associated with one another, for example, call-to-action buttons, images, and positive customer reviews. To provide you with an example, if you have a really good positive review and want to use it to increase conversion, you can place it directly below the signup form.</p>
<h3>7. High-Quality Images</h3>
<p>Photos do it all, and it is crucial that those that are used on your website match your theme and niche and that they are engaging. High-quality images raise conversion and increase the chance of returning visitors. You can either use public domain HD images, or you can purchase the license from sites that sell quality images, and strategically place them throughout your website.</p>
<p>If you want to ensure the website can establish a strong brand identity, you should hire a photographer to create HD photos of you, your team, and your office, and use these personalized elements on your website. The main idea is to utilize the images to give your site a unique identity and make it more memorable so that potential users can know where to return and eventually become loyal customers.</p>
<p>These were some of the <a href="http://www.razorsocial.com/visual-web/">simple design tricks</a> you can implement to increase the conversion rate on your website. Of course, if they are to be fully effective, you must first cover <a href="https://firstsiteguide.com/make-website/">all the basic principles of web design</a> and make sure the online platform itself is fully operational.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are looking for advice on how to create a magazine website with WordPress, then you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we will be taking a look at the essential steps required to get your magazine-style website online and ensure it’s a success.</span></p>
<h2>What is a Magazine Website?</h2>
<p>Just to ensure we’re all on the same page, let’s take a quick look at exactly what a magazine-style website is. Typically, it’s a website that publishes a steady stream of content on a specific topic or range of subjects.</p>
<p>The topic of your magazine website can be anything you choose. However, it’s important that your chosen topic contains enough scope for you to publish multiple articles on a regular basis. Your content can take many forms, from news, reviews, videos, image galleries, recipes, guides, and more.</p>
<p>The more content you publish on your website, the more visitors it will attract. Therefore, it’s vital that you and your team are prepared to stick to a busy publishing schedule and keep the new content flowing.</p>
<h2>How to Create Your Magazine Website</h2>
<p>When it comes to creating your own magazine or news website, if you follow the right path and complete the necessary steps in the correct order, you shouldn’t face too many difficulties.<br />
To give you a quick overview of the process of setting up your news website, here is a checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the right platform for your website</li>
<li>Pick a website domain name</li>
<li>Choose a suitable web hosting service</li>
<li>Install your chosen platform</li>
<li>Choose a suitable theme</li>
<li>Install and configure the theme</li>
<li>Add any necessary plugins or extensions</li>
<li>Start publishing your content</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are a few steps in the process. However, once you’ve worked your way through the list, you will have your very own magazine website.</p>
<p>As this article if focused on creating a magazine website, we will be helping you pick a suitable theme, cover some useful plugins, look at content publishing, and growing your audience. If you want to start from the very beginning, then this <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/how-to-make-a-website/">guide on how to make a website</a> will get you up to speed.</p>
<h2>Magazine Theme Shopping Checklist</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While technically you can use any good WordPress theme to create your magazine website, if you choose a template that has been built specifically for this purpose, then your project should stand a better chance of success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look at a few of the most popular news and magazine style websites, you will notice a few common traits they all share. Let’s take a look at them to help you find the right theme for your project.</span></p>
<h2>An Action Packed Homepage</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-modal-image wp-image-307 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Homepage.png" alt="Build a Magazine Website Homepage" width="694" height="486" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Homepage.png 694w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Homepage-300x210.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Homepage-100x70.png 100w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Homepage-600x420.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such trait you will find on a successful magazine website is the ability to display multiple links and excerpts from a selection of articles that have been published on the site. This type of layout ensures that when visitors arrive at the homepage of your site, much like on the cover or a traditional offline magazine, they are presented with many stories or articles to choose from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike a typical blog theme, which simply lists the latest posts on the homepage, the magazine theme may highlight a few of the most popular or recent stories, while also showcasing many other articles. A good magazine theme will help you build a homepage with plenty of options, without overwhelming the reader and causing confusing.</span></p>
<h2>A Never Ending User Journey</h2>
<p><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-More-Articles-NYT.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-308" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-More-Articles-NYT.png" alt="Build a Magazine Website More Articles NYT" width="696" height="248" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-More-Articles-NYT.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-More-Articles-NYT-300x107.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></a></p>
<p>Making your online magazine a success is all about driving traffic to your website and then keeping your visitors on your site for as long as possible. Often magazine and news websites are monetized by displaying adverts. Therefore, the greater the number of page impressions your visitors generate, the more money you can earn from advertisers.</p>
<p>Even if you plan to monetize your website in others ways, such as by selling your own products and services, through affiliate links, or in some other way, it’s usually beneficial to keep your visitors on your site for as long as possible. Each page a visitor views gives you a better chance to engage and connect with them, making them more receptive to your offers.</p>
<h3>The Best News Theme For You</h3>
<p>One key way to extend the number of pages each reader views on your site is to ensure that they always have an easy way to visit another article. This means, that no matter where they are on your site, or at what point they are in an article there are multiple links on display that they can click on to reach another page.</p>
<p>In the image above, the New York Times website displays a panel of related content at the end of each article. This is as well as displaying links in the sidebar and throughout the article text, which are on display while the visitor is reading a news item.</p>
<p>The goal is to create a never ending user journey that ensures the reader always has another story to read or article to view while browsing your magazine website.</p>
<p>Other features to look out for include an advertising management system, multiple homepage layouts, a mobile responsive design, and social media integration.</p>
<h2>Suitable WordPress Magazine Themes</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know what features and attributes to look out for when shopping for a suitable WordPress magazine theme, here are a </span><a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/magazine-wordpress-themes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">few examples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of purpose-built templates that will help you get your project off to a great start.</span></p>
<h3>Newspaper WordPress Theme</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-798" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Newspaper-8-Best-News-WordPress-Theme.png" alt="" width="803" height="675" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Newspaper-8-Best-News-WordPress-Theme.png 803w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Newspaper-8-Best-News-WordPress-Theme-300x252.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Newspaper-8-Best-News-WordPress-Theme-768x646.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Newspaper-8-Best-News-WordPress-Theme-696x585.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Newspaper-8-Best-News-WordPress-Theme-500x420.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newspaper is a popular WordPress magazine theme that was launched in 2013. Since its initial release, this theme has been constantly updated and improved to ensure it remains an innovative and modern website template.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_316" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-316" style="width: 879px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Newspaper-Theme-Menu.png"><img loading="lazy" class="td-modal-image wp-image-316 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Newspaper-Theme-Menu.png" alt="Newspaper Theme Menu" width="879" height="283" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Newspaper-Theme-Menu.png 879w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Newspaper-Theme-Menu-300x97.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Newspaper-Theme-Menu-696x224.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-316" class="wp-caption-text">Newspaper Theme Menu</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose this theme for your magazine-style website, then you will have the ability to create a homepage that will give your readers plenty of options on what to do next. This includes browsing your drop down, mega menus, jumping straight to the trending articles featured in the news ticker, or viewing the content from your category feeds.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_314" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-314" style="width: 733px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Newspaper-Category-Feed.png"><img loading="lazy" class="td-modal-image wp-image-314 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Newspaper-Category-Feed.png" alt="Newspaper Category Feed" width="733" height="434" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Newspaper-Category-Feed.png 733w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Newspaper-Category-Feed-300x178.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Newspaper-Category-Feed-696x412.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Build-a-Magazine-Website-Newspaper-Category-Feed-709x420.png 709w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-314" class="wp-caption-text">Newspaper Category Feed</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a visitor does click through to an individual article on your website, they can not only read the content but also interact with any optional videos and image galleries you’ve included. The floating main menu remains on display, as does the fixed sidebar menu. This means that your visitors will always have somewhere else to go on your site, either, when they’ve finished the article they are reading, or they’ve had enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Newspaper is ready to go right out of the box, with a prebuilt layout and configuration optimized for news and magazine websites, the theme comes with multiple homepage layouts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These homepage layouts give you a good deal of flexibility for how your visitors will be greeted when they arrive at your site.</span></p>
<h3>Customizable Layouts</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these prebuilt layouts include a blog style layout, a format for those publishing lots of video content, tech and sport focused layouts, and a lot more. For those that require more flexibility from their theme, the good news is that each of the prebuilt layouts can easily be customized without the need to edit any code. This allows you to mix and match the best elements from each, or create your own layout from scratch.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Newspaper_Travel_Demo.png"><img loading="lazy" class="td-modal-image wp-image-324 aligncenter" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Newspaper_Travel_Demo-1024x581.png" alt="Newspaper Travel Demo" width="698" height="396" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Newspaper_Travel_Demo-1024x581.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Newspaper_Travel_Demo-300x170.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Newspaper_Travel_Demo-696x395.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Newspaper_Travel_Demo-1068x606.png 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Newspaper_Travel_Demo-741x420.png 741w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Newspaper_Travel_Demo.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To further broaden your options when using this theme, Newspaper comes with a range of page templates. These templates can be used to format your articles in a specific way. Therefore, no matter what type of content you are publishing, from long-form think pieces to image heavy reports, there should be a suitable page layout to choose from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other notable features of the Newspaper WordPress theme include multiple advert locations for monetizing your content, a drag and drop photo gallery builder tool, one-click demo installation for quickly setting your website up, and full support for adding an online store and shopping cart to your website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newspaper is packed with features, while also being highly flexible, therefore if you are building a content-rich website, it’s well worth taking for a test drive.</span></p>

<h2>Creating Your Magazine Website Content</h2>
<p>Once you’ve chosen the platform for your website and installed a suitable theme or template, the real work begins.</p>
<p>Creating a successful news or magazine website is all about publishing content that will offer value to your target audience. Depending on the focus of your website, this value could be delivered in a number of ways, from informing, educating, or simply entertaining your audience.</p>
<p>As the number of articles on your website grows, so will the number of readers who will find their way to your website via the search engines. Building up an audience by relying on natural search traffic does take time. However, if you persevere and continue to publish great content, you will see results.</p>
<p>When creating content, you can choose from a range of formats. This includes written articles, video content, image-based reports, guides, and a whole lot more. Think about what format your target audience will appreciate most, and then experiment with your writing style and formatting until you find your voice.</p>
<h2>Growing the Audience of Your Magazine Website</h2>
<p>If you simply can’t wait and want to grow your audience from the outset, you can think about paying for advertising on social media networks, such as Facebook, or seeking out advertising networks and platforms that are relevant to the topic of your website.</p>
<p>Whether you decide to pay for advertising on social media or not, setting up profiles on the most popular networks in your industry is highly recommended. Some social media networks are better suited to certain topics and audiences than others are. For example, if your target audience is primarily women and your content is largely image based, then Pinterest could be the perfect social network for your project.</p>
<p>Other ways to drive traffic to your website include applying to guest post on related websites, in exchange for a link back to your site; forging partnerships with other figures in your industry; and looking for sponsorship opportunities.</p>
<p>Another vital component in your audience building strategy is setting up an email newsletter. Giving your audience a way to sign up for email updates is a proven way to turn one-time visitors into repeat readers. It’s a good idea to implement this from the launch of your website. All you need is a suitable email marketing service and an email opt-in form plugin to capture those addresses and building your newsletter.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I hope that you now have all the information you need to launch your news or magazine website. From choosing a theme, setting up social media profiles, and publishing content, there is a lot to do. However, it can be a fun journey with plenty of rewards on offer for those who stay the course.</p>

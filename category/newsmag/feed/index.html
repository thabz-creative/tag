<p>This is such an exciting day!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>New travel demo</h3>
<p>Challenge your website’s visitors to discover the joy of traveling and feed them with the energy and the beauty of the most wonderful places in the world. Sunny vibrant colors, transparency and contrast were especially added to increase the feeling generated by your stories. You just have to grab a chair and start writing on your amazing articles.</p>
<p>The new Travel demo brings you a clean, elegant and vivid design built to give you the freedom to share your amazing travel experiences and to promote exotic travel destinations. You can load this demo in a heartbeat and customize it to the extent of your unlimited creativity. Try it and take your visitors in this unforgettable journey. Let them experience the wonderful world of traveling!</p>
<h3>New custom code panel</h3>
<p>We moved all the custom code to one panel and we added auto complete and error detection to it. The code editor works with CSS, JavaScript and HTML and it detects common errors, like wrong selectors, broken HTML tags or JS code errors&#8230; it&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<div class="gif_wrap wpgp-width684">
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="gif_link_wrap wpgp-width684" title="Click to play" rel="nofollow"></a>
                        <span class="play_gif wpgp-width684">GIF</span>
                        <img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Animation-10_still_tmp.jpeg" class="_showing frame no-lazy" alt="Newspaper 6.6 custom CSS">
                   </div>
                   <img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Animation-10_still_tmp.jpeg" class="_hidden no-lazy" alt="Newspaper 6.6 custom CSS" style="display:none;">
<div class="gif_wrap wpgp-width684">
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="gif_link_wrap wpgp-width684" title="Click to play" rel="nofollow"></a>
                        <span class="play_gif wpgp-width684">GIF</span>
                        <img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Animation-11_still_tmp.jpeg" class="_showing frame no-lazy" alt="">
                   </div>
                   <img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Animation-11_still_tmp.jpeg" class="_hidden no-lazy" alt="" style="display:none;">
<div class="gif_wrap wpgp-width684">
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="gif_link_wrap wpgp-width684" title="Click to play" rel="nofollow"></a>
                        <span class="play_gif wpgp-width684">GIF</span>
                        <img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Animation-12_still_tmp.jpeg" class="_showing frame no-lazy" alt="">
                   </div>
                   <img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Animation-12_still_tmp.jpeg" class="_hidden no-lazy" alt="" style="display:none;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Performance improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>the following modules of the theme are loaded on demand now: td_log, td_remote_http, td_remote_video, td_data_source, td_video_support, td_more_article_box, td_page_views, td_review, td_ajax. This means that the theme loads them only when needed. We mesured a 10% faster load time after this tweak.</li>
<li>Before this update, the editor style sheet used in tinyMCE was dynamically compiled from less on each request. In this update we managed to use a single css file that is precompiled while still providing the WYSIWYG feeling of tinyMCE and Newspaper.</li>
<li>Each demo now also has a custom CSS compiler. This compiler is used when you change the theme color or other settings that affect the appearance of the front end and with the new system each demo can load only the required css, without selectors or aditional css for other demos.</li>
</ul>
<h3>New sorting options (via jetpack)</h3>
<p><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015-09-17_1737.png"><img loading="lazy" class="td-modal-image alignright wp-image-125" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015-09-17_1737.png" alt="Newsmag 2.3 update 2015-09-17_1737" width="133" height="171" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015-09-17_1737.png 716w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015-09-17_1737-232x300.png 232w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015-09-17_1737-696x900.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015-09-17_1737-325x420.png 325w" sizes="(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px" /></a>Starting with this version, on all of our blocks and widgets you now have the option to sort your content via the Jetpack stats module.</p>
<p>When activated, the block will show the most popular posts on your site in the last 2 days according to the data provided by the Jetpack stats module.</p>
<h3>New Visual Composer version</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-144" style="position: relative; top: -14px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Visual-Composer-Logo-150x150.png" alt="Visual-Composer-Logo-150x150" width="88" height="88" />We know you guys want the latest visual composer as soon as it comes out but we always test the plugin before we release an update to be sure that everything works as expected.</p>
<h3>Usability improvements to our widgets</h3>
<p>** Huge thanks to <a href="http://forum.tagdiv.com/topic/please-add-block-title-to-backend-widget-title/">@shubhra from our forums</a> &#8211; for providing us with a tip about how we should deal with widgets title so that it appears in the wp-admin panel.</p>
<div style="max-width: 455px;"><div class="gif_wrap wpgp-width455">
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="gif_link_wrap wpgp-width455" title="Click to play" rel="nofollow"></a>
                        <span class="play_gif wpgp-width455">GIF</span>
                        <img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Animation-8_still_tmp.jpeg" class="_showing frame no-lazy" alt="">
                   </div>

</ul>
<h2>Newsmag 2.3 update</h2>
<h3>New:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each demo now uses a separate css generator for that modifies the appearance of the theme. The theme now generates just the required css to for each demo.</li>
<li>You can now show in all the blocks and widgets site wide popular articles in the last days provided by the Jetpack plugin.</li>
<li>The new Travel Demo.</li>
<li>Custom code panel. We realized that all the custom css, html and javascript should be in one panel. We also added a custom HTML code section. All the input areas from this panel have autocomplete (ctrl+space) and error checking.</li>
<li>The theme now has it&#8217;s own logging system. We can now debug hosting issues easier.</li>

<li>Paragraphs in comments on posts and in wooCommerce now have appropriate spacing</li>

<li>Possible function name collision of our gallery filter. Thanks to @denimology form our forum for this suggestion.</li>
<li>Tabs widget from VC, the shortcode is different in the latest VC version and it loses the theme&#8217;s style</li>
<li>Non-adsense ads can be disabled responsive using the panel options</li>
<li>G+ new icon</li>
<li>Theme animations where incompatible with some plugins and the visual composer gallery. The animations still worked but all of them looked a bit strange.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The backend editor style that is present in TinyMCE no longer compiles on demand. We ship a ready compiled css and this makes the editor load faster</li>
<li>Added link to user page on login widget from top menu</li>
<li>Social counter button is clickable on the entire area</li>
<li>Almost all the javascript code now passes jshint. We still have about 15-20% of the code to refactor to the new standards but with time we will get there.</li>
<li>The theme&#8217;s data source class can now be overwritten from the child theme</li>
<li>All the widgets from the theme are now optimized to work better. All the functionality of the widget_builder class is present in the td_block_widget now.</li>
<li>The video playlist now downloads the videos metadata on render, not on save post. This allows us to use the playlist on the on click demos.</li>
<li>The following modules of the theme are loaded on demand now: td_log, td_remote_http, td_remote_video, td_data_source, td_video_support, td_more_article_box, td_page_views, td_review, td_ajax. This means that the theme loads them only when needed. We mesured a 10% faster load time after this tweak.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newsmag 2.2 was just released and in this version we made some major UI improvements and a lot of under the hood optimization. We also improved the WooCommerce experience by adding our two new plugins: <a href="http://forum.tagdiv.com/tagdiv-woo-invoice-plugin/">tagDiv woo invoicing</a> and <a href="http://forum.tagdiv.com/tagdiv-woo-label-plugin/">tagDiv label maker</a></p>
<h3>New small loader</h3>
<p>Designed to be shown on infinite loading and load more pages the new smaller loader fits better with the overall aspect of the theme.</p>
<div class="gif_wrap wpgp-width600">
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="gif_link_wrap wpgp-width600" title="Click to play" rel="nofollow"></a>
                        <span class="play_gif wpgp-width600">GIF</span>
                        <img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/newsmag_loader_still_tmp.jpeg" class="_showing frame no-lazy" alt="">
                   </div>
                   <img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/newsmag_loader_still_tmp.jpeg" class="_hidden no-lazy" alt="" style="display:none;">
<h3>Infinite loading on categories</h3>
<p>This is the first version of Newsmag that comes with configurable pagination options on each category. You can choose between:</p>
<ul>
<li>normal pagination &#8211; will show a numbered pagination at the bottom of the page</li>
<li>infinite loading pagination &#8211; when the theme detects that the user approaches the bottom area of the page, it will load the next page via ajax. Because the user will reach the end of the page only after all the posts from that category are shown, this approach is only recommended if you don&#8217;t have a footer or have a very simple footer.</li>
<li>infinite loading pagination + load more &#8211; this option loads two pages as the user scrolls down and after that it shows a load more button. This way the user can also reach the footer of the site easly</li>
</ul>
<div class="gif_wrap wpgp-width600">
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="gif_link_wrap wpgp-width600" title="Click to play" rel="nofollow"></a>
                        <span class="play_gif wpgp-width600">GIF</span>
                        <img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Animation-6_still_tmp.jpeg" class="_showing frame no-lazy" alt="">
                   </div>
                   <img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Animation-6_still_tmp.jpeg" class="_hidden no-lazy" alt="" style="display:none;">
<h3>WooCommerce plugins</h3>
<p>As WooCommerce becomes more popular we decided to add better support in Newspaper for this eCommerce platform.</p>
<p>We built two new plugins for WooCommerce: <a href="http://forum.tagdiv.com/tagdiv-woo-invoice-plugin/">tagDiv Woo Invoice</a> and <a href="http://forum.tagdiv.com/tagdiv-woo-label-plugin/">tagDiv Woo Label</a>. If you have an online store we hope that you will find them useful and as always we welcome any suggestions and feature requests for them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The full list of improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>new: we are using a new less compiler for the css. This prepares our theme for the next stage when we will optimize css delivery based on settings and components used</li>
<li>new: this is the first version of our ajax preloader. The preloader loads the ajax subcategories on the initial pageload, this provides a better user experience and in some cases a better performance if the initial page is cache.</li>
<li>new: all categories now have an option for infinite loading + load more instead of pagination</li>
<li>new: wooCommerce label maker plugin with support for label Dymo label printer</li>
<li>fix: on the ad block the sidebar ad spot cannot be selected since the last visual composer update</li>
<li>improvement: a big part of the themes JavaScript now passes jsHint and complies to WordPress JavaScript Coding standards</li>
<li>fix: live ajax search box in specific circumstances was linking to categories instead of the actual search results</li>
<li>improvement: infinite loader now has a loading animation</li>
<li>fix: issue with ajax subcategories. If you clicked them fast enough there was a chance that they will desynchronized with the content, showing the wrong content.</li>
<li>fix: the smart sidebar animates better now when it&#8217;s used with the smart affix menu</li>
<li>fix: we added the alt tag to placeholder feature images and the thumb disabled images</li>
<li>new: wooCommerce invoicing plugin</li>
<li>improvement: mega menu ajax loading now works smoother and the animation is top to bottom</li>
<li>fix: security issue with the ajax code that handles the sidebars.</li>
<li>improvement: we improved the loading animation, when needed it&#8217;s smaller and it looks better</li>
<li>improvement: the latest version of revolution slider is available</li>
</ul>

<p>With over 5 million active installations, WooCommerce is the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/">most popular eCommerce </a>plugin and has always been compatible with the Newspaper template. For example, some websites sell a few items and keep a blog to highlight their products and share news about them. Other websites are entire tech portals that sell gadgets. Starting with <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-11/">Newspaper version 11</a>, our news theme has become more WooCommerce friendly due to the new. We’ve added new, useful shortcodes and features for WooCommerce ready for you to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-what-are-woocommerce-shortcodes">What are WooCommerce shortcodes?</h3>



<p>WooCommerce shortcodes are pieces of code that you can easily insert into your posts or pages that bring eCommerce functionality. There are a few mandatory tools that must be always included in your site: shop, cart, related products, an easy-to-use filtering system, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="588" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page.jpg" alt="Create the Picture Perfect Layout for your Front Page Shop" class="wp-image-16833" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-300x147.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-1024x502.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-768x376.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-696x341.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-1068x523.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<p>Once you install WooCommerce on your site, you’ll notice that it comes with some pre-built shortcodes with the possibility to<a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/"> purchase more Woo extensions</a> and enlarge the plugin’s capabilities. However, starting with the Newspaper theme 11 update, we’ve added a new premium plugin called tagDiv Shop which is mandatory to run Shop Cloud Templates and extensive features compatible with the WooCommerce plugin. Furthermore, with the tagDiv Shop activated, you can install one of the Prebuilt eShop Websites our design team has carefully built. If you need help to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezaaE2VP7V8">install a prebuilt website design</a>, you can follow along with our video tutorial.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The homepage is the core of your website. It’s the starting point of the audience’s journey through your website, storage of vital links and data, a strategic asset for marketing goals. Most often, the homepage is the first visual and emotional touch that visitors have with your content and products. Fortunately, building homepages with Newspaper Theme is easy as a game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5114 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper.jpg" alt="Homepages with Newspaper Theme" width="1200" height="500" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-300x125.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-768x320.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-1024x427.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-696x290.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-1068x445.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-1008x420.jpg 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Homepages with Newspaper Theme</h2>
<p>If you’re creating your first website, remember to use clear structures for their homepages. Here are some important elements you can add to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headline &#8211; a short statement that reflects what the website’s all about</li>
<li>A hero element with simple imagery that should inspire your visitors to interact further</li>
<li>Call-to-action that draws the attention and uses active language</li>
<li>Present your blog content through Flex Grids and Blocks</li>
<li><a href="https://tagdiv.com/newsletter-plugin/">Newsletter subscription box</a> to attract more readers to follow and keep up-to-date with your content</li>
<li>Good navigation elements such as links in the menu to take the users easily across the website, a search function, and social network buttons</li>
<li>Testimonials to increase your credibility</li>
<li>A section with team members to help readers build an emotional connection with you</li>
</ul>
<p>These are popular elements for any Homepage. However, it should not be a limit to you, as you can always add more sections and items. Homepages with Newspaper Theme? The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p><video class="td-center td-article-img-border" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="1200" height="632"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source type="video/mp4" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Homepage.mp4"></video></p>
<h2>Homepage Templates</h2>
<p>Your goals are essential when you start out. Do you want to dabble in e-commerce? Are you going to use the site as a blog? Or, maybe, showcase your portfolio of works and creative products. You should know the answer before starting the process and design the website to best serve that purpose.</p>
<p>Newspaper Theme offers a variety of Homepage designs to choose from to begin easily. From the WordPress Admin Dashboard, open the Cloud Templates section and click on the “Add New” button. You will be greeted with a digital library of our designers’ creations, with over a thousand templates; from Article, Author, and <a href="https://tagdiv.com/find-whats-new-category-templates/">Category Page Templates</a> to <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introducing-new-404-page-templates/">404 Page Error ones</a>, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Choose the Homepage tab and scroll down to see each design. Click on the one that catches your eye to see a live preview of it, or import it directly to your website. After the import is over, &nbsp;make it a part of your vision! Edit and customize each element to your heart’s desire and create something brand new.</p>
<h2>Make your Custom Homepage</h2>
<p>In your Admin Dashboard, navigate to the Pages section and click on the “Add New” button. Give the page a title such as Index or Homepage. Save the page. Press the “tagDiv Composer” button to access the front-end editing section.</p>
<p>Let’s make an efficient yet beautiful Homepage. Add a Hero Element by dragging and dropping it onto the blank page. The item has a default appearance and settings, so click on it to open the settings and customize it to perfection! Write a short description of your site’s purpose and draw the readers in through a short Title.</p>
<p><video class="td-center td-article-img-border" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="1200" height="686"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source type="video/mp4" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Create-your-own-homepage-with-Newspaper-Theme.mp4"></video></p>
<p>For content-heavy websites, the general advice is to add a Flex Grid and Flex Block to display all of your relevant posts and articles. However, the decision is in your hands.</p>
<p>If you want to interact with your audience further, add a Row with the Team Member Element. This gives you the possibility to showcase everyone contributing to your website, from authors to designers. Include a description for each member to allow the visitors to build an emotional connection with you.</p>
<h2>Creation, design, perfection</h2>
<p>Keep the layout nice and simple. Here’s a tip: create gaps between sections using white space to help your visitors navigate through the page easily. Add relevant information on the homepage such as a small showcase of your products, testimonials from clients, ads to monetize your site, buttons that invite your readers to engage further. The sky is the limit on what you can create!</p>
<p>Each element that you add on the page with the tagDiv Composer can be clicked on to customize even further. Choose font families in accordance with your vision. Color palettes are great to maintain through each page and the entire website.</p>
<p>For example, for a non-profit organization whose goal is to stop deforestation, their site’s color palette could be browns and greens to inspire the idea of trees and nature. Think of a travel beach resort website. They might use blues and yellows to represent the sun and the blue summer sky and help you immerse yourself in the dream vacation they want to portray. So, pick them to serve your goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the essential elements of the Newspaper Theme is a row. It is a container that is used to put every element in coherently, one after the other. This way, it can create different types of layouts. But how does one make the row stretch all across the page or split it into columns? Let’s explore some of the basics in today’s tutorial.</p>



<h2 id="h-row-add-delete-duplicate">Row, Add, Delete, Duplicate</h2>



<p>Open a page or template with the tagDiv Composer. It can be either imported straight from the Cloud Library or crafted from scratch. Now, whenever you scroll upon various elements, you can see a blue bar appear at the top of the row with a few options.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="177" height="17" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/row-basics-icons.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15805"/></figure>



<ul><li>If you click on the row button, it will open the General Settings tab for that row.&nbsp;</li><li>The next icon duplicates the current row with all of its content and settings.</li><li>The column button behaves the same as the row button.</li><li>Whichever element you’re scrolling over can be opened by clicking on the element button.</li><li>You can also duplicate the element with the second icon in the bar.</li><li>The last icon deletes the current element you’re scrolling over.</li></ul>



<p>These icons are essential for everyday basic functionality. Acquaint yourself with them, and things will become much more manageable while editing and crafting a beautiful page.</p>



<p>To delete a row, you can also scroll over the row button, click on it and drag it to the bottom-left corner of the page. A delete pop-up will appear, asking you to confirm the deletion. The same can be done for the column and any element on the page.</p>



<h2 id="h-general-settings-tab">General Settings tab</h2>



<p>Let’s explore the first few options you can see when opening the row settings: </p>



<div class="wp-block-image td-article-img-border"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="407" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/general-settings-for-row.jpg" alt="General Settings for Rows" class="wp-image-15807" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/general-settings-for-row.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/general-settings-for-row-221x300.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>The Layout lets you split the row into multiple columns. Just click on the icon, and you can see the changes happening live.&nbsp;</li><li>Columns gap lets you increase or decrease the space between columns. All you need to do is write down a number in the box.</li><li>“Vertical align” adjusts the position of the content. From left to right, the icons adjust the content to the top, middle or bottom.</li><li>The Full height option makes the row have a set value in height.</li><li>If you check the “hide on pagination” box on templates that require multiple pages (such as Category pages), the row will be hidden.</li><li>The “Add Parallax” option applies only if you have a background image set on the row. It will move the image slowly up and down as you scroll past the row.</li><li>With the “turn off bg transition” checked, when the page loads in, if you have a background image set on the row, it loads instantly and won’t gradually fade in.</li><li>A fixed background image stays in a fixed position when the user scrolls down the page.</li><li>Choose colors and create a beautiful background with the background gradient.</li><li>The Shadow properties allow you to give the row its own shadow. The first setting lets you input the size of it. Whereas the next two options lets you offset it vertically, and horizontally. Next up is the spread &#8211; this measures how far the shadow should go. And lastly, you get to choose the color of it.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-youtube-sticky-rows">YouTube &amp; Sticky Rows</h2>



<p>The last few options left are the YouTube ID, class, and making the row sticky.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="370" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sticky-row-settings.jpg" alt="Video Background Settings for Rows" class="wp-image-15808" title="td-article-img-border" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sticky-row-settings.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sticky-row-settings-243x300.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>If you check the “Sticky” checkbox, the row keeps being displayed even if you scroll past it. The dropdown menu lets you choose whether it should be shown at the top or bottom of the page.</li><li>To give your row more life, you can add a YouTube ID in the box that will play a YouTube video automatically, muted, on loop. Pick the YouTube video you want to display and copy &amp; paste the numbers and letters that come after <strong>watch?v=&nbsp;</strong></li><li>You can also choose to start the video at a set time by inputting the number of seconds in the box.</li><li>If you want to increase the size of the video, use the scale box.</li><li>The opacity slider controls how visible the overall video will be.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-row-stretch">Row Stretch</h2>



<p>One of the most critical features for a row is its stretch capabilities. A row can stretch all the way across the page horizontally. That is something you can do through the tagDiv Composer using the stretch row dropdown menu. When you first click on it, you can see the various options presented to you:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image td-article-img-border"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="214" height="151" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stretch-row-dropdown-menu.png" alt="Stretch Row Dropdown menu" class="wp-image-15809"/></figure></div>



<ul><li>Default is 1080 pixels wide, and if you set a background color, it will be constrained within those pixels.</li><li>The stretch row keeps the 1080 pixels width but allows the background image / color to stretch across the page horizontally.</li><li>Stretch row and 1200px/1400px/1600px/1800px content adjust the row according to those sizes written.</li><li>Stretch row and content allow you to expand the row until it hits the left and right margins of the screen.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>You also get the option to “stretch row off.” Once you hit this checkbox, you can see the background color stretch to the left and right sides of the screen. This works in the same way the “Stretch Row” option does.</p>



<h2 id="h-background-image">Background Image</h2>



<p>Just as we’ve seen above, you can add background images and have the image not change position while scrolling down or gradually move up and down with parallax. However, how do you add a background image on the row? For that, we need to travel to the CSS tab.</p>



<p>Under the CSS tab, you will first meet the varying options for margins and paddings.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="272" height="222" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/paddings-and-margins-for-row-css-tab.jpg" alt="Settings for Rows: Margins and Paddings" class="wp-image-15810"/></figure></div>



<p>Each box refers to a different thing. The outermost boxes are the margins of the element, in this case, the row’s margins. The second most row, the one in the middle, is the border. Suppose you want to add a border spanning all the way across the row, you would need to input a number in each of the four second most boxes. The inner ones are padding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Underneath all of that, you can choose the style and color of the border. However, what we’re interested in, lies even further below that: the background image. If you click on the background image option, it lets you choose a photo from the media Library or upload a new one entirely. Keep in mind, if the row is stretched horizontally (using the options mentioned above) the image needs to be large enough so that it maintains its high quality.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-background-image-options">Background Image Options</h3>



<p>Background style lets you choose how the image behaves with a dropdown menu:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="123" height="87" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/background-image-repeat-on-row.jpg" alt="Background Image for Rows" class="wp-image-15811" title="td-article-img-border"/></figure></div>



<ul><li>Cover makes the image cover the entirety of the row, stretching it in various directions.</li><li>Contain shrinks or enlarges the image down to the height of the row.</li><li>No repeat places the image into the row without stretching it in any direction.</li><li>Repeat duplicates the image so that it spans all across the row.</li></ul>



<p>The background position dropdown menu affects the image placement so that it shows the middle, the bottom or even the top of it using the background style settings.</p>



<p>And the last background image option is the background opacity. If you’ve chosen an image, you can lower the image’s opacity so that it only shows a bit of it, like a silhouette.</p>



<h2 id="h-row-layout-divider">Row Layout &amp; Divider</h2>



<p>There are two more tabs when you open a row: the Divider and Layout tabs. The Divider lets you place a vector on the background of the row, creating various shapes to attract the viewer’s interest. Heaps of various geometrical forms can be achieved and maintain the contrast between different elements on the page. If you want to learn more about it, we have a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/row-divider/">Divider Tutorial<strong> </strong></a>on our blog.</p>



<p>The Layout tab covers many new features that affect the way your content is shown on the page. You can adjust the content within a column to display differently compared to the rest. Modify the order of columns for various devices, adjust the width of the row and columns, and plenty more. To explore these features, we suggest reading more about the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/flexibility-rows-columns-newspaper-theme/">Layout Options</a> on our blog.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Now that we’ve explored all the varying degrees with which you can diversify and create interesting layouts using the rows in Newspaper Theme, it’s time to put this knowledge to good use. Open the tagDiv Composer and let your imagination run wild. Design something entirely new, filled with inspiration and creativity! Show us your best results in the comment box below.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-10-3-7/">Newspaper 10.3.7 update</a> brings you new tools to craft beautiful pages for mobile devices. We know how important mobile pages are for your audiences. They must be responsive and the content adapted to the small screens. This time, we’ve redesigned and rethink the way you were creating your pages for mobile devices. Enhanced for optimization and flexibility, tagDiv Composer is the frontend page builder that makes everything possible. You can now build mobile pages and upload only the elements that are really necessary, without showing the full menu, and with all the shortcodes within your grasp. Let’s demonstrate how easy it is to create and customize mobile pages with the Newspaper theme, right on the frontend of your site!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="681" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-editing.jpg" alt="Edit the Mobile Page" class="wp-image-14322" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-editing.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-editing-300x170.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-editing-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-editing-768x436.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-editing-696x395.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-editing-1068x606.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Newspaper Mobile Web Design &amp; Customizability</h2>



<p>With the tagDiv Composer page builder, you have now unlimited customization possibilities to design mobile pages. Until today, it was not possible to build mobile pages from scratch, with their own shortcodes, without all the elements shown on desktop. Newspaper 10.3.7. update allows you to create pages specially-crafted for mobile screens with stunning flexibility, and this will improve your overall page speed and page usability.</p>



<p>With the new way of creating mobile pages, you’ll definitely have the most appealing and fully-functional website. The freedom of customizing mobile pages to your liking will boost your UX and UI results. It’s the same website, but whole new experience for your visitors. It is not enough to ensure a responsive and adaptive website design that automatically resizes the content of a page or post. Starting with the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-10-3-7/">Newspaper 10.3.7 version</a>, you can mix and match elements for the mobile pages live, right on the frontend of your site.</p>



<h2>How to Create a Mobile Page with tagDiv Composer</h2>



<p>If you want to create a new mobile page, you first have to go on the website’s frontend and choose a particular page or template to edit. The main functionality of the new mobile page system can be found at the top of the screen, near the “<span style="background-color:#00a364" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Edit with TagDiv Composer</span>” tab, and it is called “<span style="background-color:#1c1d1e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Mobile Page</span> .” Here’s an example of how this should look:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="466" height="150" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/no-mobile-page-2.png" alt="No Mobile Page" class="wp-image-14294" title="" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/no-mobile-page-2.png 466w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/no-mobile-page-2-300x97.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /></figure></div>



<p>If you click on the “Mobile Page No mobile page” tab and the page does not have a mobile version, then it will appear the following message &#8220;<strong><em>No mobile page, please import or create a new mobile page</em></strong>&#8220;<strong> </strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="510" height="335" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/copy-content.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14296" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/copy-content.jpg 510w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/copy-content-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></figure></div>



<p>A new mobile page can be created by pressing the + icon at the right of the mobile page section. The newly created mobile page is blank by default, but you can check the <span style="background-color:#b5dcaf" class="td_text_highlight_marker"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span>Copy Content box below the mobile page name and hit the Create button. This option is going to copy the whole desktop content and paste it automatically into the new mobile page for easier content manipulation. Then, if you’ll open the dropdown, all the existing mobile pages for this page in particular will appear one beneath the other.</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14298" width="250" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page.jpg 1920w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-300x170.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-768x436.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-1536x871.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-696x395.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-1068x606.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption>Click the Create Mobile Page button from the tagDiv Composer front-end pagebuilder. The Button is right beneath your Save Settings.</figcaption></figure></div></a></div>



<p>Furthermore, if you’re currently editing a page with the tagDiv Composer page builder, you can easily build a mobile template or just edit it. Below the tagDiv Composer menu, you have the page breadcrumbs, and two important sections called <span style="background-color:#c4cdd1" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Edit&nbsp;</span>and <span style="background-color:#c4cdd1" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Create Mobile Template</span></p>



<p>All the mobile templates that you’ve created can be found in the WordPress Admin Dashboard; you’ll see the mobile pages in the pages sections, and the mobile templates in the &nbsp;<span style="background-color:#2665b6" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Cloud Templates.</span></p>



<p>If you open the backend of your Newspaper website and navigate to the Pages area, you’ll see two new columns added. The Mobile Page column shows if a particular page or template has a mobile page assigned or not to it, while the Mobile Template column informs you what type of page it is (mobile or not).</p>



<h2>How to Edit The Mobile Pages</h2>



<p>If you are on the frontend of your website and open a specific page, you have to navigate to the top of the page and click on the “<span style="background-color:#373d40" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Mobile Page</span> ” tab to open the dropdown. When you hover over the wanted template, you can edit the mobile page by using the <strong>small pencil button</strong> next to the mobile page name. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="468" height="163" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-the-pencil-icon-to-edit-the-page-1.png" alt="Click the Pencil Icon to edit" class="wp-image-14307" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-the-pencil-icon-to-edit-the-page-1.png 468w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-the-pencil-icon-to-edit-the-page-1-300x104.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></figure></div>



<p>Once you press the pencil button, you will be redirected to tagDiv Composer in the editing mode. From here you can add, remove, and adjust the block elements you want to show on your mobile pages.</p>



<h2>Header and Footer for Mobile Pages</h2>



<p>Every website should have a top and bottom area. This is the nicest way to say hello and say goodbye to your visitors. Headers and footers on mobile devices should be just as appealing as the ones from your website’s desktop versions. With Newspaper Theme and the Website Manager within the tagDiv Composer page builder it’s easy to select or import a header and footer for your new mobile page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1089" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr.png" alt="Website Manager" class="wp-image-14328" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr.png 1920w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-300x170.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-1024x581.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-768x436.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-1536x871.png 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-696x395.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-1068x606.png 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>tagDiv themes have been developed with performance in mind, with every feature having a well-established purpose. Newspaper or Newsmag themes give you the possibility of building everything you were always trying to achieve with your website. The Newspaper and Newsmag WordPress themes come with <a href="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-install-plugins-and-update-plugins/">required plugins and optional ones</a> included, such as tagDiv Composer, tagDiv Cloud Library, tagDiv Social Counter, tagDiv AMP, Revolution Slider, and more. Besides the <a href="https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/213762463-Bundled-Plugins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plugins that come bundled</a> with the news themes (for which you do not have to pay extra money), there are some standalone plugins that are compatible with the tagDiv themes. In the WordPress &gt; Dashboard, you can see the list of the plugins compatible with the Newspaper Theme, respectively, with the Newsmag theme.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both themes are fully customizable and come with flexible, intuitive features. Sometimes this is not enough, and customers want to extend the themes’ functionality by installing different plugins regardless if they are tested or not with Newspaper or Newsmag. In this article, we’ll take a look into what exactly is the plugin compatibility, the ups and downs, as well as the recommended and tested plugins that work seamlessly with the Newspaper theme and Newsmag theme.&nbsp;</p>

Compatibility is also important for any plugins you purchase and upload the file to your admin dashboard,” notes <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/tagdiv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluehost </a>in their <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/blog/how-to-check-if-your-plugins-are-compatible-with-your-site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to check the plugins’ compatibility with your website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-why-you-should-use-the-tested-plugins">Why You Should Use the Tested Plugins&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Every website owner wants his website to perform at its very best. But what happens when something goes wrong? When you’ve worked a lot to write great content, mix and match elements on the frontend to get the wanted results, and after you save the page, something isn’t right. You’ll say that the elements are rearranged and that the tagDiv Composer keeps loading, so you’ll assume that the theme is doing it, while this is all about a plugin conflict that was not tested with our theme. Do you think it’s a singular situation? Not really. This can happen every time you install a new untested plugin.</p>



<p>According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/" target="_blank">recent Kinsta WordPress statistic</a>s, there are over 55,000 plugins in the WordPress directory. Besides, there are the ones that are outside the WordPress repository and are available in free or premium versions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="660" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reading-which-plugin-is-compatible-with-which.jpg" alt="Compatibility between plugins" class="wp-image-14164" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reading-which-plugin-is-compatible-with-which.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reading-which-plugin-is-compatible-with-which-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reading-which-plugin-is-compatible-with-which-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reading-which-plugin-is-compatible-with-which-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reading-which-plugin-is-compatible-with-which-696x383.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reading-which-plugin-is-compatible-with-which-1068x587.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-can-untested-plugins-do-on-your-website">What Can Untested Plugins Do on Your Website? </h2>



<p>Plugins that are not tested with our WordPress themes can ruin your website and all the work you’ve invested in it. We’ve made a list of the most common sceneries you wouldn’t want to happen to you and your site. Untested plugins can:</p>



<ul><li>cause conflicts with the tagDiv Composer page builder and the tagDiv Cloud Library</li><li>crash your website and give multiple errors</li><li>grant site access for hackers, if plugins are not constantly updated</li><li>the support team behind a WordPress plugin cannot provide support if a theme has not been fully tested with the plugin. In this case, both us or the plugin’s support team cannot assist you with technical issues.</li><li>change how a feature works, but in a distinct way than other plugins.</li><li>might be developed to work with a different WordPress version.</li><li>be poorly-designed or badly coded.</li><li>overlap with plugins already installed on your site.</li></ul>



<p>In case you have untested plugins installed on your Newspaper or Newsmag websites and encounter an issue that is not related to our WordPress themes, we recommend you to use another environment to deactivate all your plugins and install the required plugins. Reactivate other plugins one by one and test your website on the frontend to see when the unusual situation appears.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-if-i-really-need-an-untested-plugin-what-should-i-do">What If I Really Need an Untested Plugin? What Should I Do?</h2>



<p>There are cases when you might need to use an untested plugin with tagDiv themes. You could send us an email, and we’ll add it to the list of plugins and test it with the Newspaper or Newsmag themes. This action will take a while, because we receive multiple requests, and choose the ones that are most popular. Meanwhile, you could create a staging WordPress website or a testing copy of the live website, and install the plugin to test it out. If the tested plugin works as expected with our themes, you can move it to the live website.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>We know that WordPress plugins give you extra functionality and that you may tend to use multiple ones, even if you do not necessarily need them. The multitude and variety of plugins can also ruin your site’s overall performance, security, reliability, and speed. Some good practices advise you never to exceed 20 plugins installed on your website and use a maximum of five if your website is on cloud or shared hosting. However, there are reputable websites using many more plugins that are all compatible with their database, resources, and HTTPS requests; and still maintain the website’s performance at high standards. This depends on how good you are with technical stuff.</p>

<p>Are you looking to start a blog to share with your friends, family, and build a supportive online community? The new Mintyside PRO demo is the perfect blend of simplicity and minimalism that is not only user-friendly but also allows you to focus on creating content. Write about interesting topics, create eye-catching titles, and let Newspaper Theme handle the full website’s design &amp; its functionality.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="843" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into.jpg" alt="Mintyside PRO demo Homepage into" class="wp-image-13933" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-300x211.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-1024x719.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-768x540.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-696x489.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-1068x750.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Mintyside PRO: intro</h2>



<p>A blog can be anything from reporting on the latest trending topics (celebrities, politics, entertainment, finance, news coverage), delivering trusted information to technological and scientific developments. Even more, you can keep a daily blog as a recollection of memories, experiences, and tutorials for readers to enjoy. The Newspaper Mintyside PRO demo allows you to turn your website into the blog of your dreams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a wide-set layout, a grey background that goes perfectly with the turquoise accent colors, it embodies a feeling of freshness and energy. Combining a sans-serif font with a serif one and dividing the page into three columns, it leaves the viewers feeling like they’re reading an actual physical newspaper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By importing your featured images and content, your articles will be the center of the homepage. Monetizing your blog should also be a breeze with the Newspaper Theme’s <a href="https://tagdiv.com/ad-box-newspaper-theme/">ad box</a> and Newsletter subscription block. Award your long-time readers and entice the new ones to subscribe and send them weekly notifications about your most important blog posts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="641" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles.jpg" alt="Mintyside PRO demo Related Articles" class="wp-image-13934" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-300x160.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-1024x547.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-768x410.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-696x372.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-1068x570.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Breeze along</h2>



<p>Mintyside PRO demo gives you options to show off your content in different manners<a href="https://tagdiv.com/header-main-menu-newspaper-theme/">, the header main menu</a><strong> </strong>is set perfectly for not only mega menu with subcategories, simple mega menu, and even submenus. With dashed borders on hover and shadows for blocks, the demo highlights both the menu and the search bar.</p>



<p>With white rows upon a grey background, headings, excerpts, and categories, the Mintyside PRO demo makes it easier for you to build a brand and share amazing stories with the world. Each featured image can become part of a segment you want to push forward: color schemes, color theory, illustrations, photography, and more.</p>



<h2>Installing Mintyside PRO demo</h2>



<p>Version 10.3.6 of Newspaper Theme came bundled up with<a href="https://tagdiv.com/embrace-summer-with-five-new-pro-demos-newspaper-theme/"> various new demos</a>: Magazine PRO, Lifestyle PRO, Scuba PRO, Retro Blog PRO, and Mintyside PRO. Owning a copy of Newspaper Theme gives you access to all these new demos by simply updating it. If you need more information about that, there’s an in-depth tutorial on <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introduction-to-newspaper-theme-automatic-updates/">how to update your Newspaper Theme.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="652" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1.jpg" alt="Mintyside PRO demo Single Post Template" class="wp-image-13936" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-300x163.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-1024x556.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-768x417.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-696x378.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-1068x580.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>To install the Mintyside PRO demo, you need to access your WordPress Admin Dashboard. From there, navigate to Newspaper Theme &gt; Install Demos. Scroll down the page to find the one you’re looking for and hover over it to choose between:</p>



<ul><li>Design Only lets you import only the templates, colors, fonts, homepage.</li><li>With content comes with all the sample content: the categories and posts are included in the import.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The main difference between the two of them is the fact that once you uninstall the demo and install another one, the sample content (categories &amp; posts) are also removed from the website. If you already have content of your own, it’s best to go with “Design Only.”</p>



<h2>Header Adjustments</h2>



<p>One of the first things you should do after installing the demo is to make changes that showcase your brand and what the blog’s all about. Go to the homepage and open it through the tagDiv Composer. In the header section, click on the Logo element and upload your pre-designed logo as an image, copy and paste it as a SVG code or even create a new one with text and fonts.</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo.jpg" alt="Edit the Logo" class="wp-image-13943" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo.jpg 1890w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-300x145.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-1024x495.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-768x371.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-1536x742.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-696x336.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-1068x516.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1890px) 100vw, 1890px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>The next item on the agenda is the main menu. Click on it, and from the General Settings tab, choose a menu you’ve created using the WordPress widget. You can always create a new one from the Admin Dashboard &gt; Appearance &gt; Menus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scroll down the page to change the logo and menu for the sticky header, too. And last but not least, using the device bar of the tagDiv Composer, click on the mobile view and change the logo and menu for the mobile device and mobile sticky.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="642" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template.jpg" alt="Author Template Mintyside PRO" class="wp-image-13937" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-300x161.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-1024x548.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-768x411.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-696x372.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-1068x571.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Let’s tackle the Homepage</h2>



<p>When you open the page with the tagDiv Composer you need to filter or offset Flex Blocks. To do this, click on one of them and travel to the Filter tabs. Now, sort the articles by author, categories, tags, or even by ID. From the General Tab, you can add an offset by inputting a number in the box.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the right column, you have an ad box that can show your affiliates’ ad image. Upload the photo you want to use in the Image ad tab and write the URL. Scrolling down, you have more Flex Blocks elements and a Subscription box, and to the left side of it, a Background Image set on column. The background image can be replaced by navigating to the Column &gt; CSS tab and then choosing a different image.&nbsp;</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1.jpg" alt="Edit the Subscription Box" class="wp-image-13945" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1.jpg 1797w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-300x134.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-1024x456.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-768x342.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-1536x685.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-696x310.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-1068x476.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1797px) 100vw, 1797px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>The subscription box also needs your <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newsletter-plugin/">Mailchimp / Feedburner / MailerLite</a> code. From the General tab, choose your provider and copy-paste the embedded code in the box. Right below this, you have another ad box that you can replace with a different image and URL. The rest of the page only contains one more flex block and a Posts Loop. The Flex block can be filtered or offsetted according to what you wish to show. Save your settings!</p>



<h2>Templates</h2>



<p>The most important part of adjusting your <a href="https://tagdiv.com/what-is-the-cloud-library/">Cloud Library Templates </a>is to showcase different articles through the flex blocks used on them. And just like above, you can filter or offset them. This applies to all the templates, so just hit the “Edit Template” button and make your adjustments.</p>



<p>Moreover, on the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introducing-new-404-page-templates/">404 Template</a>, you need to add a URL that leads back to your homepage. So just copy and paste the website’s link to the button. The Author and Single Post Template have an ad box that needs to be replaced, too. Once you’re done, save your settings!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="621" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Category-Template-1.jpg" alt="Category Template" class="wp-image-13940" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Category-Template-1.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Category-Template-1-300x155.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Category-Template-1-1024x530.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Category-Template-1-768x397.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Category-Template-1-696x360.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Category-Template-1-1068x553.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Market your site’s originality</h2>



<p>If you want to change the demo’s layout, colors, fonts, you need a plan in mind. Take a look at our<strong> </strong><a href="https://tagdiv.com/typography-guide-101-basics-tips-ideas-inspiration/">typography guide </a>to understand the basics of contrast, tracking, and font-weight. Then choose fonts that are web-safe from the online gallery of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Fonts</a>. Now when you open a page or template through the tagDiv Composer, you can easily alter the fonts by going into the “Style” tab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For colors, you need a primary and an accent color to create contrast and highlight important items. To better understand color complementaries, monochromatic and analogous schemes, you should learn the basics of<strong> </strong><a href="https://tagdiv.com/color-theory-newspaper-theme/">Color Theory.</a> With a color palette in mind, replace the colors on your templates and pages using the Style tab of the elements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And last but not least, the magical tagDiv Composer allows you to make any layout alterations you need. They all can be done on the front-end by dragging and dropping items in the desired order. Create new rows, columns, adjust paddings, margins, and even borders. Once you have everything perfectly aligned, save your settings!</p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>Whether you want to modify the demo to fit your vision or not, Mintyside PRO is capable of adapting to any type of blog. Everything can be adjusted right on the frontend, without any HTML or CSS skills/knowledge, so building your site is a breeze. Newspaper Theme’s PRO demos are entirely customizable from top to bottom. Once you hit that install demo button, the layout is perfect from the get-go! And remember, content is king.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tagDiv Cloud Library brings you over 1200+ already-built layouts. We have designed it to simplify the way you create layouts in the Newspaper theme and make your website stand out! The innovative system of tagDiv Cloud Library allows you to import templates and customize them using the drag and drop functionality.</p>



<p>The plugin has three significant purposes:</p>



<ul><li>Helps you <strong>create stunning templates and pages</strong> quickly, without the hassle of adding CSS code;</li><li>Allows you to <strong>use of the tagDiv Composer</strong> on all WordPress templates;</li><li>Provides a <strong>growing database of pre-made templates</strong>, homepage, sections, blocks and so forth.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube alignwide wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Newspaper WordPress Theme Tutorial: How to Import and Assign Cloud Library Templates" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6m8-EebnfM0?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>With the tagDiv Cloud Library, there’s no need to create your content from scratch. You can easily import the selected element, and use it directly or customize it to your preference and style. You can also import pages easily with one click! Just add your content straight through the tagDiv Composer, and you have a beautiful page from scratch. Find out more about the tagDiv<a href="https://tagdiv.com/cloud-library-page-templates-newspaper-theme/"> Cloud Library Page Templates here</a>.</p>



<p>Think of it as a template builder that comes with a vast collection of layouts for every section of your site. You can browse the tagDiv Cloud Library collection, preview the unique designs, and import the one(s) you love!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="687" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library.jpg" alt="activate tagdiv cloud library" class="wp-image-13658" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-300x172.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-768x440.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-696x398.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-1068x611.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-tagdiv-cloud-library">How to use tagDiv Cloud Library</h2>



<p>First, make sure to activate the plugin from the theme plugins section:</p>



<p>Then go to either a category, author, tag, date, or post on your website. As long as you’re logged in, the WordPress admin bar contains a green button: Cloud Library. Click it to open the tagDiv Cloud Library and browse through the selection of predesigned templates. If you want to create your own, choose the “Blank Template” one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Click on any of them to open their “Create Template” window. Hit the button to have it imported and assigned straight onto the page you’re currently on. Great! But how do you set it globally? What if you want the current template to be on all your categories or posts? To the left of the “Cloud Library” button on your WordPress admin bar, you have your template button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you click on this tab, it opens a dropdown window with every template suitable for the page you&#8217;re editing. It should look something like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="422" height="276" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a-template-list.png" alt="a template list" class="wp-image-13654" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a-template-list.png 422w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a-template-list-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /></figure>



<p>Any Template that you click on is applied on the current page. Please note that it does not get set globally. To assign it globally, you need to check the box next to the wanted template. Then, every page of the same type will use the template assigned by you globally.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1197px"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-to-Import-a-Cloud-Library-Template.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2 id="h-duplicate-rename-delete-templates">Duplicate, Rename, Delete Templates</h2>



<p>From the same dialogue box previously opened, you can delete, rename, and duplicate templates. When hovering over the title of a template, three dots appear to the right of it. Move your cursor top of the dots to get access to the following icons<img loading="lazy" width="57" height="19" class="wp-image-13641" style="width: 57px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/icons-for-templates.png" alt="icons for templates">.</p>



<p>Let’s explore each one starting from the left, moving to the right:</p>



<ul><li>The trash can icon deletes the template hovered upon. Any deleted templates can be found in the trash of your WordPress Admin Dashboard &gt; Cloud Templates &gt; Trash.</li><li>To the right of the trash icon, you have the duplicate icon. It makes a copy of the template.</li><li>When you click on the pencil icon, you can rename the template. This is perfect for organizing all templates.</li></ul>



<p>Now that the Template button has been fully explored, let’s move on to editing and creating a new template from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Delete-rename-and-duplicate-Templates-with-the-new-template-button.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2 id="h-create-templates-from-scratch">Create Templates from Scratch</h2>



<p>Before we jump into the creation process, check out the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">tagDiv Composer basics tutorial </a>to familiarize yourself with the workflow of dragging-and-dropping items to create your page’s layout. When you travel to a category, post, tag, date, search, or author page, next to the “Cloud Library” button on your WordPress Admin Bar, there is an “Edit Template” button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is only available if you have installed a demo, or imported a template already. When you click it, you get to drag and drop elements that are necessary for your audience. Keep in mind the user experience &#8211; you want every functionality to be highly visible and easily accessible. Take a look at our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/a-guide-to-avoid-web-design-mistakes/">guide to avoid design mistakes</a> and learn what the do’s and don’t’s of web design are.</p>



<p>Keep everything cohesive, restrict the number of fonts you use on the template to a maximum of three. If you need inspiration, you can also take a look at our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/seven-design-trends-for-2020/">2020 Design Trends,</a> which encompasses the year’s most popular styles. Once you’re done creating the elements, stylizing them, and choosing colors, save your settings by clicking the save icon on your tagDiv Composer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="43" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tagdiv-composer-bar.png" alt="tagdiv composer bar" class="wp-image-13642"/></figure>



<h2 id="h-let-s-sum-it-up">Let’s sum it up</h2>



<p>By exploring different templates and finding out what works best for your website, you get experience. Newspaper Theme opens up a whole new world of creation and possibilities as each choice can impact your audience. Design something stunning that makes use of excellent user experience to connect better with your viewers.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With Newspaper Theme 10.3.5 comes a whole bunch of new features for arranging your page or template’s layout. More mobility, ease of access, and faster options to move, align, and order your elements in your rows or columns. If the old school way to make advanced customizations was via the CSS box, now it’s possible to tweak those aspects by clicking some icons. Let’s learn what the new flexible rows and columns do.</p>



<h2>Layout Choices</h2>



<p>First of all, make sure you’re up-to-date with the Newspaper Theme version. If you’re new to updating your WordPress Theme, take a look at our tutorial on <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introduction-to-newspaper-theme-automatic-updates/">automatic updates</a>. Now, navigate to a page or template that you want to edit. Open the tagDiv Composer, our front-end pagebuilder. New to using the drag-and-drop editor? Discover <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">how to move and arrange elements</a> with<strong> </strong>tagDiv Composer first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Either drag-and-drop a new row into the page or just click on an already-existing one. Split the row into 2-4 different columns. Go to General and choose between the predefined column choices. You might have noticed a new tab called “Layout.” Click it to explore a whole new set of adjustments.</p>



<p>The first row contains three options:</p>



<ul><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13590" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/off-turned-on.png" alt="off-png"> &#8211; if you leave it on OFF, you deactivate the feature for the row you’re on.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13591" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/vertical-columns.png" alt="vertical columns"> &#8211; keeps the layout of the row arranged in columns vertically.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13592" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/row-columns.png" alt="row columns"> &#8211; each column gets aligned horizontally.</li></ul>



<p>Right below those, you get a checkbox to rearrange the columns in reverse order. The second option lets elements wrap inside the column, just like a text. Once you activate an option, you can see the changes happening live on the page and how your new layout looks.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Horizontal-Alignment-for-Columns.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2>Horizontal Alignment</h2>



<p>The next few settings refer to the placement of the items inside a row or column. So let’s say that you have a column with an item shorter than the total width of the column. How would you move it to the left or right side of it? You might try to add paddings or margins to the CSS settings of it. However, there’s a straightforward solution now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Click on the column you would like to modify. Now turn on the column settings ( <img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13591" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/vertical-columns.png" alt="vertical columns"> ). Right next to “Horizontal Align” are these available options:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13593" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/left-align.png" alt="left align"> &#8211; is turned ON by default and arranges all elements to the left side of the column.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="18" height="19" class="wp-image-13594" style="width: 18px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mid-align.png" alt="mid align"> &#8211; moves components to the center of the column.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13595" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/right-align.png" alt="right align"> &#8211; aligns the item on the right side of the column.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13596" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/space-evenly.png" alt="space evenly"> &#8211; works only with multiple items that are displayed on the same row and column. It distributes them to the left and right sides of the column.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13597" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dustribute-evenly.png" alt="dustribute evenly"> &#8211; just like the previous option, it only works when there are multiple elements on the same row and column. It creates an even distance between the items.</li></ul>

<h2>Vertical Alignment</h2>



<p>Do you want elements to align in the center of your row without adding unnecessary amounts of CSS? With the Vertical Alignment options, each row or column can be moved to the center, bottom, or even to the top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like with the horizontal alignment icons, there are a few icons for the vertical alignment:</p>



<ul><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13616" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/top-align.png" alt="top align">  &#8211; is turned ON by default and arranges the elements starting from the top.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="15" class="wp-image-13617" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/center-align.png" alt="center align"> &#8211; aligns the objects to the middle of the row.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13618" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bot-align.png" alt="bottom align"> &#8211; moves the items to the bottom of the row.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="10" class="wp-image-13619" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/baseline.png" alt="baseline align">  &#8211; the objects align on a horizontal line so that the text’s baseline sits on top of it.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13620" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/stretch.png" alt="stretch columns"> &#8211; this option, when turned ON on the row, makes every column equal in height to the tallest one. This is a great option to vertically align items within their columns and even to create proportionate colored backgrounds within the columns.</li></ul>



<h2>More Options, More Accessibility!</h2>



<p>The last two features for flexible rows and columns in the Layout tab are the Order and Width boxes. They allow you to control the way your content sits on the page and rearrange items differently on various devices.</p>



<h3>Order</h3>



<p>By default, it’s set on Auto, which means the columns appear one after the other exactly as you see them on the page. If you have multiple columns, at the very least 2, you can easily switch to a tablet or mobile view through the &nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="272" height="30" class="wp-image-13630" style="width: 272px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/device-bar.png" alt="device bar" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/device-bar.png 272w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/device-bar-265x30.png 265w" sizes="(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px" />&nbsp; device bar and have the columns show up in a different order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you do this? Click on the column you want to show up first and input a number. It can be any number, but for simplicity’s sake, write down 1. Now go to the second column and write down a number that’s higher than the first one; in our case, we can go from 2 to ∞. The columns should now show up with the “1” before the “2” column.</p>



<p>This is absolutely fantastic when you move to smaller devices and want your content to be the centerpiece of the website.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Width</h3>



<p>This feature works brilliantly on both the flexible rows and columns if you want to increase or decrease the amount of space they take up on the page. </p>



<p>Put in any measurement in the box, and it will increase the content accordingly. You can use pixels, percentages, points or anything as long as it is marked by the correct shortening. View a <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_measurement_units.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full list of measurements</a> here. So, if you want that column or row to increase its size, just input it in the box. </p>



<h3>Flexibility at Your Fingertips</h3>



<p>Let’s say you’ve decreased one column’s width, what happens to the rest of the columns? Most likely, they will stay at their existing width if you haven’t increased it. To make it easier, we’ve created a set of options that automatically calculate the remaining space in the row and adjust the column’s width accordingly. Let’s explore the options next to the “Occupy remaining space in row” option:</p>



<ul><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13621" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/default.png" alt="default settings"> &#8211; it is turned ON by default. It lets each column remain at the size they were when you first created the row.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13622" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/on.png" alt="turn the feature on"> &#8211; if you turn the option ON, it will adjust the column’s width to fill the rest of the row.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13590" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/off-turned-on.png" alt="off-png"> &#8211; turns the option OFF.</li></ul>



<p>Remember that this icon &nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13591" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/vertical-columns.png" alt="vertical columns">&nbsp; needs to be turned ON on the row for this feature to work properly.</p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>As with every new feature, the best part about it is implementing it creatively on your Newspaper website. With so many options and combinations, there’s plenty to explore and discover. Moreover, there’s much to be done with the new flexible rows and columns: widening columns, stretching background colors, arranging items, and organizing your site in a simple manner!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ready to start a blog? Become the frontrunner of a locally-brought news source or just share your insights on new technology. Show stories from all around the world with a beautiful website design. Newspaper Theme 10.3.3 released 6 new demos that are meant to stun and wow the audience. One of which is the dark yet cozy-looking PRO demo AmberLight. Let’s explore all that it has to offer and why you should consider installing it on your website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="587" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero.jpg" alt="AmberLight PRO Demo hero" class="wp-image-13479" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-300x147.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-1024x501.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-768x376.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-696x340.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-1068x522.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>AmberLight: intro</h2>



<p>Emboldened by a dark background, the text and images will stand out among each page and template with AmberLight PRO. As such, your blog can deliver the content the viewers want to read in an enjoyable fashion. Combining the warm tones of yellow with turquoise and a dark green-blue, the site gets modernized while maintaining a level of comfort in aspect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bright neon turquoise tends to slip on the cyberpunk color scheme and gives the page’s elements a retro-futuristic vibe. Take advantage of this accent color as it seamlessly blends with a website focused on technological advancements. Moreover, the amber hue plays an essential role in warming up the entire layout. Contrasting widely against the cool-shades of turquoise, the golden tones are perfect for any type of blog.</p>



<h2>Taking a Dive into the Deep-End</h2>



<p>As we’ve previously seen, each <a href="https://tagdiv.com/geometric-web-design-newspaper-theme/">geometric shape has its own meaning</a>. Any element that is rounded and has no sharp edges represents harmony and safety. Consequently, AmberLight PRO demo follows that theory as each item has a curved smooth surface. Moreover, according to <a href="https://uxmovement.com/thinking/why-rounded-corners-are-easier-on-the-eyes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UX Movement</a>, while sharp corners take away focus from inside a rectangle, rounded corners place the viewer’s attention inside it.</p>



<p>Another different pair, just like the color scheme, are the shapes which appear in the design. Taking away from mathematical equations, we have polar opposites: the plus and minus sign, which are predominant throughout the demo. Of course, the last polarity of the layout is the hover effect of any feature post image, which turns black and white. By taking away the color of the photo, the feature crosses into another contrasting threshold. It marks the dissimilitude between monochromatic and colorful.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="529" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles.jpg" alt="Featured Articles AmberLight" class="wp-image-13480" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-300x132.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-1024x451.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-768x339.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-696x307.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-1068x471.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Installing AmberLight PRO</h2>



<p>When you update the Newspaper Theme to the latest version, you get access to all the recent features and PRO demos. Version 10.3.3 comes packed with 6 new demos, one of which is AmberLight PRO. If you’re new to WordPress, we have a helpful article on <a href="https://tagdiv.com/update-newspaper-theme/">how to update Newspaper Theme</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the Admin Dashboard, go to Newspaper Theme &gt; Install Demos. You can look for AmberLight on the side column, which shows a list of all the possible demos you can install, or scroll down the page to the featured demo image. When hovering over the demo’s photo, the <strong>Install </strong>button pops up. Moreover, right next to it, there&#8217;s a switch that allows you to import the entire demo’s articles, categories, menu items, images, and links.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your website has no content, and you want to test out how AmberLight would look, install it by letting the demo “Include Content.”&nbsp; However, if you’ve already started publishing articles and posts, flip the switch over to “Design only.” This option installs the demo without actually adding the articles and posts. Because when you uninstall a demo, it will delete all the categories and posts it came with.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="339" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/footer.jpg" alt="AmberLight PRO footer" class="wp-image-13488" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/footer.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/footer-300x85.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/footer-1024x289.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/footer-768x217.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/footer-696x197.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/footer-1068x302.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Header &amp; Footer</h2>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo.jpg" alt="AmberLight PRO change the logo name" class="wp-image-13481" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo.jpg 1582w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-300x143.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-1024x487.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-768x366.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-1536x731.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-696x331.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-1068x508.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1582px) 100vw, 1582px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>When first installing a demo, you need to make some changes to truly showcase your website. For starters, if you’re new to using the tagDiv Composer we advise you to check out the<a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/"> basic tips and tricks</a> for our frontend page builder. Now open the homepage using the tagDiv Composer and click on the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/create-a-logo-with-newspaper-theme/">Header Logo</a>. In the General Settings tab, scroll down to the “Text” section and write your website’s name inside the text and tagline boxes. Whichever word you input in the text box will be white, while the tagline will be golden. Upon hover, the colors will switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Save the settings. Go to the Admin Dashboard then to &gt; Appearance &gt; Menus. If you have already created a menu with pages, items, categories, and various other links, you can skip this step. If that&#8217;s not the case, then start dragging the homepage, and any categories you want to showcase. Make items mega menu elements or even create sub-menus. If you need more information about that, check out our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/header-main-menu-newspaper-theme/">main menu article</a>. Save the created menu, then open the tagDiv Composer on your homepage again. Click on the Main Menu item and choose your predefined menu in the drop-down list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Repeat these steps for the mobile menu by going to the Website Manager button in the top left corner of your tagDiv Composer and clicking on the mobile view. When you finish, scroll down to the bottom of the page and choose 3 different list menus for the footer. Change your Header Logo here, too, and finally: Save!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="880" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks.jpg" alt="Homepage Flex Blocks" class="wp-image-13490" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-300x220.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-1024x751.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-768x563.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-696x510.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-1068x783.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Homepage Adjustments</h2>



<p>If the frontend page builder is still open on the homepage, let’s take this moment to make some further adjustments. Click on the first Flex Block on the page. When importing the demo, it will display your latest posts but you can go to its Filter settings tab and choose to display a preferred category. The next Flex Block on the page can show a different category, or if you want, just add an offset so that it skips over the first few posts. Go to the General tab and add a number in the Offset Posts box. Great! Now continue filtering the rest of the Flex Blocks for the page.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the ad that appears on this page. Click on it and go to the Image Ad tab. This is where you upload an affiliate’s photo. Moreover, copy-paste the affiliate’s link in the Ad URL box. If you want to use Google Ads, go to the Custom Ad tab and input the code there. You’re done! Save the settings.</p>



<h2>Templates &amp; Contact Page</h2>



<p>The steps you’ve taken above can be applied for the rest of the templates of the website, as well. Edit them by going to the Admin Dashboard &gt; Cloud Templates and choosing which one to start &gt; Edit Template. This should open the template with tagDiv Composer using sample content. If you want a live preview of it, however, just navigate to where it’s used. For example, for single Post Templates, open an article and hit the “Edit Template” button on your admin bar.&nbsp;</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url.jpg" alt="Change the button's URL" class="wp-image-13485" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url.jpg 1600w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-300x155.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-1024x530.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-768x397.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-1536x795.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-696x360.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-1068x553.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>AmberLight PRO has a straightforward and direct layout design. So, all you need to do for most templates is filter Flex Blocks to display different posts and adjust codes for your Ad Boxes. The only template that needs something else done to it is the 404 Template. It contains a button that needs a link back to the homepage. Click on the button through the tagDiv Composer, and go to the General Settings tab. In the “Button URL” box type in your website’s address. Save!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="767" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page.jpg" alt="AmberLight Contact Page" class="wp-image-13494" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-300x192.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-1024x655.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-768x491.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-696x445.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-1068x683.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Contact Page</h2>



<p>The demo also comes with its very own contact page that you can edit to your liking. Let’s go to the frontend page builder and see what needs to be edited. The first item that needs adjustment is the button: it needs a link just like the 404 Template one. Add a link to your email address using the “mailto:emailaddress” form.&nbsp;</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress.jpg" alt="Add your email address for the button" class="wp-image-13493" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress.jpg 1600w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-300x146.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-768x373.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-1536x746.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-696x338.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-1068x519.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>Let’s check out the next element, which is a text element. All you need to do for this one is to insert your personal contact information replacing the sample one. Push the “Edit Content” button from the element’s General Settings tab. Now write your correct addresses and numbers. Great! Right below this item is a social links one. Click on it and add your precise social media usernames.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And last but not least, this element is a Flex Block. Filter it by a favorite category or add an offset to adjust what posts you want to show, and you’re done! Save.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Make AmberLight personal</h2>

<p>If you already have a color palette you want to stick to, change both the row’s background color and text colors. Links, hovers, buttons, anything can be modified. Just click on any item you want to change and go to its style or CSS tab. In fact, the newest version of the Newspaper Theme has a search bar function. Just type in “color” to see exactly what you need marked by a red dot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go through each page and template and gradually turn the demo into something stunning that wows your audience. Don’t forget to save consistently!&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the essential elements of the Newspaper Theme is a row. It is a container that is used to put every element in coherently, one after the other. This way, it can create different types of layouts. But how does one make the row stretch all across the page or split it into columns? Let’s explore some of the basics in today’s tutorial.</p>



<h2 id="h-row-add-delete-duplicate">Row, Add, Delete, Duplicate</h2>



<p>Open a page or template with the tagDiv Composer. It can be either imported straight from the Cloud Library or crafted from scratch. Now, whenever you scroll upon various elements, you can see a blue bar appear at the top of the row with a few options.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="177" height="17" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/row-basics-icons.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15805"/></figure>



<ul><li>If you click on the row button, it will open the General Settings tab for that row.&nbsp;</li><li>The next icon duplicates the current row with all of its content and settings.</li><li>The column button behaves the same as the row button.</li><li>Whichever element you’re scrolling over can be opened by clicking on the element button.</li><li>You can also duplicate the element with the second icon in the bar.</li><li>The last icon deletes the current element you’re scrolling over.</li></ul>



<p>These icons are essential for everyday basic functionality. Acquaint yourself with them, and things will become much more manageable while editing and crafting a beautiful page.</p>



<p>To delete a row, you can also scroll over the row button, click on it and drag it to the bottom-left corner of the page. A delete pop-up will appear, asking you to confirm the deletion. The same can be done for the column and any element on the page.</p>



<h2 id="h-general-settings-tab">General Settings tab</h2>



<p>Let’s explore the first few options you can see when opening the row settings: </p>



<div class="wp-block-image td-article-img-border"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="407" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/general-settings-for-row.jpg" alt="General Settings for Rows" class="wp-image-15807" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/general-settings-for-row.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/general-settings-for-row-221x300.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>The Layout lets you split the row into multiple columns. Just click on the icon, and you can see the changes happening live.&nbsp;</li><li>Columns gap lets you increase or decrease the space between columns. All you need to do is write down a number in the box.</li><li>“Vertical align” adjusts the position of the content. From left to right, the icons adjust the content to the top, middle or bottom.</li><li>The Full height option makes the row have a set value in height.</li><li>If you check the “hide on pagination” box on templates that require multiple pages (such as Category pages), the row will be hidden.</li><li>The “Add Parallax” option applies only if you have a background image set on the row. It will move the image slowly up and down as you scroll past the row.</li><li>With the “turn off bg transition” checked, when the page loads in, if you have a background image set on the row, it loads instantly and won’t gradually fade in.</li><li>A fixed background image stays in a fixed position when the user scrolls down the page.</li><li>Choose colors and create a beautiful background with the background gradient.</li><li>The Shadow properties allow you to give the row its own shadow. The first setting lets you input the size of it. Whereas the next two options lets you offset it vertically, and horizontally. Next up is the spread &#8211; this measures how far the shadow should go. And lastly, you get to choose the color of it.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-youtube-sticky-rows">YouTube &amp; Sticky Rows</h2>



<p>The last few options left are the YouTube ID, class, and making the row sticky.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="370" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sticky-row-settings.jpg" alt="Video Background Settings for Rows" class="wp-image-15808" title="td-article-img-border" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sticky-row-settings.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sticky-row-settings-243x300.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>If you check the “Sticky” checkbox, the row keeps being displayed even if you scroll past it. The dropdown menu lets you choose whether it should be shown at the top or bottom of the page.</li><li>To give your row more life, you can add a YouTube ID in the box that will play a YouTube video automatically, muted, on loop. Pick the YouTube video you want to display and copy &amp; paste the numbers and letters that come after <strong>watch?v=&nbsp;</strong></li><li>You can also choose to start the video at a set time by inputting the number of seconds in the box.</li><li>If you want to increase the size of the video, use the scale box.</li><li>The opacity slider controls how visible the overall video will be.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-row-stretch">Row Stretch</h2>



<p>One of the most critical features for a row is its stretch capabilities. A row can stretch all the way across the page horizontally. That is something you can do through the tagDiv Composer using the stretch row dropdown menu. When you first click on it, you can see the various options presented to you:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image td-article-img-border"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="214" height="151" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stretch-row-dropdown-menu.png" alt="Stretch Row Dropdown menu" class="wp-image-15809"/></figure></div>



<ul><li>Default is 1080 pixels wide, and if you set a background color, it will be constrained within those pixels.</li><li>The stretch row keeps the 1080 pixels width but allows the background image / color to stretch across the page horizontally.</li><li>Stretch row and 1200px/1400px/1600px/1800px content adjust the row according to those sizes written.</li><li>Stretch row and content allow you to expand the row until it hits the left and right margins of the screen.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>You also get the option to “stretch row off.” Once you hit this checkbox, you can see the background color stretch to the left and right sides of the screen. This works in the same way the “Stretch Row” option does.</p>



<h2 id="h-background-image">Background Image</h2>



<p>Just as we’ve seen above, you can add background images and have the image not change position while scrolling down or gradually move up and down with parallax. However, how do you add a background image on the row? For that, we need to travel to the CSS tab.</p>



<p>Under the CSS tab, you will first meet the varying options for margins and paddings.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="272" height="222" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/paddings-and-margins-for-row-css-tab.jpg" alt="Settings for Rows: Margins and Paddings" class="wp-image-15810"/></figure></div>



<p>Each box refers to a different thing. The outermost boxes are the margins of the element, in this case, the row’s margins. The second most row, the one in the middle, is the border. Suppose you want to add a border spanning all the way across the row, you would need to input a number in each of the four second most boxes. The inner ones are padding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Underneath all of that, you can choose the style and color of the border. However, what we’re interested in, lies even further below that: the background image. If you click on the background image option, it lets you choose a photo from the media Library or upload a new one entirely. Keep in mind, if the row is stretched horizontally (using the options mentioned above) the image needs to be large enough so that it maintains its high quality.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-background-image-options">Background Image Options</h3>



<p>Background style lets you choose how the image behaves with a dropdown menu:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="123" height="87" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/background-image-repeat-on-row.jpg" alt="Background Image for Rows" class="wp-image-15811" title="td-article-img-border"/></figure></div>



<ul><li>Cover makes the image cover the entirety of the row, stretching it in various directions.</li><li>Contain shrinks or enlarges the image down to the height of the row.</li><li>No repeat places the image into the row without stretching it in any direction.</li><li>Repeat duplicates the image so that it spans all across the row.</li></ul>



<p>The background position dropdown menu affects the image placement so that it shows the middle, the bottom or even the top of it using the background style settings.</p>



<p>And the last background image option is the background opacity. If you’ve chosen an image, you can lower the image’s opacity so that it only shows a bit of it, like a silhouette.</p>



<h2 id="h-row-layout-divider">Row Layout &amp; Divider</h2>



<p>There are two more tabs when you open a row: the Divider and Layout tabs. The Divider lets you place a vector on the background of the row, creating various shapes to attract the viewer’s interest. Heaps of various geometrical forms can be achieved and maintain the contrast between different elements on the page. If you want to learn more about it, we have a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/row-divider/">Divider Tutorial<strong> </strong></a>on our blog.</p>



<p>The Layout tab covers many new features that affect the way your content is shown on the page. You can adjust the content within a column to display differently compared to the rest. Modify the order of columns for various devices, adjust the width of the row and columns, and plenty more. To explore these features, we suggest reading more about the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/flexibility-rows-columns-newspaper-theme/">Layout Options</a> on our blog.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Now that we’ve explored all the varying degrees with which you can diversify and create interesting layouts using the rows in Newspaper Theme, it’s time to put this knowledge to good use. Open the tagDiv Composer and let your imagination run wild. Design something entirely new, filled with inspiration and creativity! Show us your best results in the comment box below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you just start your blog with Newspaper Theme? Great! In this article, we explain how to power up your website with valuable insights using Google Analytics. With accurate data about your audience &#8211; age, gender, location, traffic source (how they landed on your site), the most popular content on your website and conversions &#8211; you can plan effective business strategies and grow your business faster. Are you asking yourself why you should use it?</p>
<p>I’ve made a list of the four main reasons:</p>

<li>It brings you data about the demographic characteristics of your audience helping you to be more effective</li>

<h2>Analytics 101: How to set up your Google Analytics</h2>
<p>Google Analytics is created by Google to help website owners understand their customers. If you are a publisher and your goal is to bring visitors back to read more of your amazing content or an e-commerce website that aims to get as many conversions, as fast as possible, <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google Analytics</a> is&nbsp;the free tool you need to analyze data and grow your business.</p>
<h3>Create a Google Analytics account</h3>
<p>To set up a Google Analytics account, you need a Google Account. Think of your Google account as the access point for all your Google products and tools. If you don&#8217;t have a Google account yet, it takes a few minutes to <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&amp;flowEntry=SignUp" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">create a new one</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7982 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-First-step-to-setup-a-new-account.png" alt="Google Analytics First step to setup a new account" width="1250" height="386" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-First-step-to-setup-a-new-account.png 1250w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-First-step-to-setup-a-new-account-300x93.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-First-step-to-setup-a-new-account-768x237.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-First-step-to-setup-a-new-account-1024x316.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-First-step-to-setup-a-new-account-696x215.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-First-step-to-setup-a-new-account-1068x330.png 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" /></p>
<p>Once it is done, you can create a new<a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Google Analytics account</a>. Click the button, and you&#8217;ll be redirected to the setup page. The <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Analytics help</a> is quite comprehensive, and you&#8217;ll go through the process in no time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7935 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account.png" alt="Google Analytics Setup Your Account" width="1200" height="900" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account.png 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-300x225.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-768x576.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-1024x768.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-80x60.png 80w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-265x198.png 265w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-696x522.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-1068x801.png 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-560x420.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to give your Analytics an account name, enter your website name, and add your domain name. After you complete these steps, Google will automatically generate your tracking code for the website.</p>
<p><iframe class="td-extend-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lZf3YYkIg8w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>With this, the basic setup is ready. Theoretically, now all you have to do is add the Google Analytics script to the &lt;head&gt; tag and see the data flowing in after 24 hours. But practically, &#8230; it&#8217;s not! Think about it: how does Analytics suppose to know what actions are essential to you on your website? Are you selling something? Are you aiming for leads? It’s engagement on content vital? If you insert the script in the site now, you&#8217;ll be missing out almost all the goodies.</p>
<h2>2. Clear objectives = Great, insightful data</h2>
<p>Yeah! You must change the Google Analytics script to track actions and metrics that are important on your website. If you have some Java or PHP skills, you can do it by yourself. If not, you can hire a developer to do it for you as this step is a heavy technical one.</p>
<p>But first, you need to get things crystal clear in mind about your website objectives. Make a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the key pages, shopping cart pages?</li>
<li>File downloads like .pdfs, apps you want to track inside Google Analytics</li>
<li>On-page events like video views, forms, button clicks</li>
<li>Does this site need e-commerce tracking?</li>
<li>What are the critical conversion points like &#8220;thank you&#8221; pages, signups, lead capture pages, newsletters?</li>
</ul>
<p>After generating this list, you should have a clear idea about what do you need to track as actions and conversions on your website. Your Google Analytics should focus on your essential metrics and help you to reach your objectives. Let&#8217;s see some example of objectives with potential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Key Performance Indicators</a> defined.</p>
<blockquote class="td_pull_quote td_pull_left"><p>According to <a href="https://www.klipfolio.com/resources/articles/what-is-a-key-performance-indicator" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Klipfolio</a><br />
A Key Performance Indicator is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving key business objectives. High-level KPIs may focus on the overall performance of the business, while low-level KPIs may focus on processes in departments such as sales, marketing, HR, support and others</p></blockquote>
<h3>Objectives and KPIs</h3>
<p><strong>Objective Pageviews/traffic:</strong><br />
<strong>Potential KPIs:</strong> Total pageviews, sessions by source/medium, top landing pages, top organic keywords, page value, time on page, goal conversions.</p>
<p><strong>Objective e-commerce/sales:</strong><br />
<strong>Potential KPIs:</strong> Total revenue, e-commerce conversion rate, page value, conversion rate by source/medium, sales by product category, return on ad spend (ROAS), conversion rate by gender/age and interest category, conversion rate by external campaign name.</p>
<p><strong>Objective lead generation:</strong><br />
<strong>Potential KPIs:</strong> Goal conversions, conversion rate by landing page, page value, conversion rate by source/medium, conversion rate by gender/age and interest category, contact form submissions by landing page.</p>
<p><strong>Objective affiliate/commission-based programs:</strong><br />
<strong>Potential KPIs:</strong> Outbound clicks per landing page, content group conversion rates, page value, traffic by source/medium, top landing pages, top external links clicked by page.</p>
<p>Decide what are the most valued KPIs for your website&#8217;s objectives and customize the tracking code to make sure this fantastic tool called Google Analytics brings you all the essential metrics in a way you can easily understand and make strategic decisions.</p>
<h2>3. How to customize the tracking code to see everything that&#8217;s important</h2>
<p>If you are selling something on your website, the first thing you&#8217;ll want to do is activate the Ecommerce tracking. Navigate to the Admin panel &gt; View level and enable the Ecommerce settings. That&#8217;s easy. Now comes the technical part. Head over <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/ecommerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google Analytics reference guide</a> and check the instructions for sending data about transactions and/or item metrics to your Google Analytics.</p>
<p><code>ga('ecommerce:addTransaction', {<br />
'id': '1234', &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Transaction ID. Required.<br />
'affiliation': 'Acme Clothing', &nbsp; // Affiliation or store name.<br />
'revenue': '11.99', &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Grand Total.<br />
'shipping': '5', &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Shipping.<br />
'tax': '1.29' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Tax.<br />
});</code></p>
<p>For content creators and publishers, e-commerce tracking is useless. Adding custom dimensions like Author or seeing engagement on AMP traffic in Google Analytics, it&#8217;s another story and could be a gold mine to grow your website.</p>
<p><code>ga('send', 'pageview', {<br />
'dimension5': '&lt;!--?=$author?'&gt;<br />
});</code></p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve made all these customizations on the code, it should be ready to install on the page.</p>
<h2>4. Installing the Google Analytics script in Newspaper Theme</h2>
<p>Go to your <strong>Google Analytics Account &gt;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Admin panel Property</strong>, open the <strong>Tracking Info</strong> section, and click the <strong>Tracking Code</strong> option. Copy the Global Site Tag and add the sitewide customizations you&#8217;ve made in the previous step. Here is an example of customized code.</p>
<p><code>ga("create", "UA-XXXXXXXX-1", "auto", {<br />

<p>When you are using the <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newspaper Theme</a> or a <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newsmag-news-magazine-newspaper/9512331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsmag Theme</a> on your website, adding the tracking code is easy. Navigate to your website <strong>WordPress Admin</strong> area &gt; <strong>Newspaper</strong> &gt; <strong>Theme Panel</strong> &gt;<strong> Analytics/JS Codes</strong> section and paste the code in the &#8220;<strong>Head Script Code</strong>&#8221; box. Hit the <strong>Save</strong> Button.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7967 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code.png" alt="Newspaper Theme: How to add Google Analytics code to track traffic on WordPress Website" width="1200" height="781" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code.png 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code-300x195.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code-768x500.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code-1024x666.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code-696x453.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code-1068x695.png 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code-645x420.png 645w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Now, verify if the code is present in the page by opening the page in the browser, in the Incognito mode, and search in the source of the page for &#8220;gtag.js.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="td_pull_quote td_pull_left"><p>Tip: If you are using a caching plugin, consider clearing the cache after adding the Google Analytics tag.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Newspaper Theme will automatically insert your script on every page, sitewide, and you don&#8217;t have to worry about it. Even after updating the theme and/or WordPress, your tracking will still be present on your WordPress.</p>
<p>In Newspaper Theme, you can add all the tracking codes in the Analytics section and forget about them.</p>
<h2>5. Using Google Analytics Events</h2>
<p>After you&#8217;ve added the script, you should see the data about your traffic flowing in the first 24 hours. You can see insightful data about your audience: age, sex, location, where are they coming from, how do they interact with your pages.</p>
<p>But when dive into data, you&#8217;ll notice that your tracking is at the page level, and this means that you can&#8217;t see any data about how visitors clicked the buttons, links, calls to action or video plays. For this, you still need to take an additional step and <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033068?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1033067" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">create events</a> for Google Analytics.</p>
<h3>What is a Google Analytics event?</h3>
<p>According to Google, &#8220;events are user interactions with content that can be tracked independently from a web page or a screen load (&#8230;) Downloads, mobile ad clicks, gadgets, Flash elements, AJAX embedded elements, and video plays are all examples of actions you might want to track as Events.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can also use <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033068?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1033067" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google Analytics Events</a> to track interactions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of clicks on a button</li>
<li>Number of clicks to outbound links</li>
<li>How much time the audience watched a video</li>
<li>Form abandonment</li>
<li>Number of times users downloaded a file</li>
<li>Number of times visitors shared a blog post</li>
</ul>
<p>The event tracking code has four elements: <strong>category, action, label</strong>, and <strong>value</strong>. The tracking code snippet example:</p>
<p><code>onclick=ga(‘send’, ‘event’, [eventCategory], [eventAction], [eventLabel], [eventValue]);</code></p>
<p>Replace the placeholders with your customized elements based on the events you want to track. Then place the entire code snippet on your page.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7970 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer.png" alt="Newspaper Theme: Adding Tracking on button for newsletter in tagDiv Composer" width="1200" height="881" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer.png 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer-300x220.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer-768x564.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer-1024x752.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer-80x60.png 80w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer-696x511.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer-1068x784.png 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer-572x420.png 572w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve made the change to the code, you can track the activity on buttons or form submissions. In the Newspaper Theme, you can add events right on the element. Simply add the info into the Tracking section, and the theme implements it for you.</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>Tip: Don&#8217;t forget to generate a list of the events you need to create to reach your website objectives. The purpose is always to have a clear image of your events, as Google Analytics is generating so much information that is easy to lose track of the essential.</p></blockquote>
<h2>6. Tracking traffic with UTM parameters</h2>
<p>If you want to track your efforts to drive traffic to your website from your email, PPC, and referral traffic using Google Analytics, you need to use campaign tracking. You can easily create UTM parameters and bring external data to your Google Analytics account.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve shown you how to customize the tracking code to send meaningful data to your Google Analytics account to help you understand who is your audience and how your visitors interact with your website. The <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033863" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Campaign tracking</a> doesn&#8217;t require the modification of the tag in the site, as it is used on the link level.</p>
<h3>What are the UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) parameters?</h3>
<p>&#8220;UTM parameters are simply tags that you add to a URL. When someone clicks on a URL with UTM parameters, those tags are sent back to your Google Analytics for tracking.&#8221;, according to Kissmetrics.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7979 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UTM-parameters-campaing-tracking-structure.jpg" alt="The structure of a link with UTM parameters for campaign tracking" width="1200" height="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UTM-parameters-campaing-tracking-structure.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UTM-parameters-campaing-tracking-structure-300x75.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UTM-parameters-campaing-tracking-structure-768x192.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UTM-parameters-campaing-tracking-structure-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UTM-parameters-campaing-tracking-structure-696x174.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UTM-parameters-campaing-tracking-structure-1068x267.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>The UTM parameters and UTM tracking are straightforward to use and highly effective in finding out which links are the most effective in driving traffic to your content.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">five UTM parameters</a>:<br />
<code>utm_source</code> &#8211; Identifies which site sent the traffic like Facebook or your email newsletter, and is a required parameter.<br />
<code>utm_medium</code> &#8211; Identifies what type of link was used, such as cost per click or social media, affiliate, and so on.<br />
<code>utm_campaign</code> &#8211; Identifies a specific product promotion or strategic campaign.<br />
<code>utm_term</code> &#8211; Identifies search terms.<br />
<code>utm_content</code> &#8211; Identifies the clicked content that brought the user to the site. It is a good solution for A/B testing and content-targeted ads.</p>
<h3>How to create a link with UTM parameters?</h3>
<p>Let me introduce you to the <a href="https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google Analytics Campaign URL Builder</a>. It&#8217;s a form inside the Google Analytics help center. You can complete it to add the information to your link automatically. When you are done, copy the link and paste it where you need it. No coding skills are required.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7974 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder.png" alt="Analytics Campaign URL Builder: How to create a custom UTM Parameters " width="1200" height="1069" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder.png 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder-300x267.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder-768x684.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder-1024x912.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder-696x620.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder-1068x951.png 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder-471x420.png 471w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>URL tracking is straightforward to set up and use providing precious insights about your traffic. But, only if you send data into a clear, easy to understand way.</p>
<h3>Be consistent with your UTM parameters</h3>
<p>Create a convention to help you be consistent in naming your campaigns and avoid a lot of confusion in data analysis. The recommendations are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use dashes</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t repeat yourself</li>
<li>Keep it simple</li>
<li>Make your parameters easy to read</li>
</ul>
<h3>Track your UTM parameters in a spreadsheet</h3>
<p>Make your life easy and record all the links with parameters in a spreadsheet. Every time you need to create a new one, you&#8217;ll know exactly what campaigns and parameters you&#8217;ve already used.</p>
<p>Also, it will help your team use the same conventions, ultimately keeping your Analytics data clean and clear. You can use a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xDl9GdpuWB9kzXzWxKj3NYt392T6l6Tq9e89Yieg8AM/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free spreadsheet template</a> like the one shared by Sam Wiltshire to get started or simply create a new one.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Now, that you have the tracking setup on your website and you are receiving data from your marketing efforts, take a look at the reports in Google Analytics at least once a week. Tracking the traffic on your website is the first step you make to grow your online business, whether you are a publisher or an e-commerce website.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: If you already have a forum user created, the last prompt is not available.</p>

<p><a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Newspaper Theme</a> comes with 63 unique designs for your website. Our demos are carefully tested, so you don’t have to create everything from scratch. Installing demos is the fastest way to get started. Choose a template, a click, and you’re done.</p>
<h3>Preview / Installing Demos:</h3>
<p>You can preview the desired demo before installing it. Go to <b>Newspaper &gt; Install demos</b> section. There you can find all of our available demos. Choose the one you like and click on the <b>Preview</b> button to preview a demo or <b>Install</b> button to install a demo.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-7-new-fully-customizable-demos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new 7 Fully Customizable Demos</a> that allow you to edit every item on any page and template and add your content straight on the front-end through the tagDiv Composer. Now, designing can be a piece of cake!</p>
<h2>Quick Install for a Demo</h2>
<p>You can also use the Quick Install panel, but note that it automatically installs the demo content.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-4687 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Newspaper.jpg" alt="Newspaper WordPress Theme: Installing Demos" width="1200" height="747" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Newspaper.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Newspaper-300x187.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Newspaper-768x478.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Newspaper-1024x637.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Newspaper-696x433.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Newspaper-1068x665.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Newspaper-675x420.jpg 675w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Include / Exclude content:</h2>
<p>You can install a demo importing all settings and content or just the settings. Go to <b>Newspaper &gt; Install demos</b> section. Choose the one you like and turn to ON or OFF the Include content setting.</p>
<ul>
<li>When this option is <b>ON</b>, the demo also installs the content (posts, categories, menus, and many more).</li>
<li>When this option is <b>OFF</b>, the demo includes just the predefined settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-4723 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/install-demos-content-and-without-content.jpg" alt="install demos content" width="1200" height="747" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/install-demos-content-and-without-content.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/install-demos-content-and-without-content-300x187.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/install-demos-content-and-without-content-768x478.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/install-demos-content-and-without-content-1024x637.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/install-demos-content-and-without-content-696x433.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/install-demos-content-and-without-content-1068x665.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/install-demos-content-and-without-content-675x420.jpg 675w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p><b>Important notice</b><b>: </b>If you choose to install a demo with content, do not edit the content and use it as your site content, because the content gets removed when uninstalling or switching demos.</p>
<h2>Uninstall a demo:</h2>
<p>If you decide to change the demo or uninstall it, the import system makes sure that your website is clean: no additional sidebars, menus or content. It leaves your website just like it was before you installed the demo.</p>
<p>To uninstall a demo go to <b>Newspaper &gt; Install demos</b> section. Click on the <b>Uninstall</b> button.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-4688 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Uninstall.jpg" alt="Install Demos" width="1200" height="747" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Uninstall.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Uninstall-300x187.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Uninstall-768x478.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Uninstall-1024x637.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Uninstall-696x433.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Uninstall-1068x665.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Install-Demos-Uninstall-675x420.jpg 675w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Combining multiple demo elements:</h2>
<p>Demos can be installed only one at a time so you cannot combine multiple demos from the section presented in this guide, but you can import sections or entire pages from other demos using the Cloud Library plugin. Please refer to the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/category/documentation/cloud_library/">Cloud Library section</a> for more details on how this can be achieved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These are the recommended Newspaper theme requirements under which the template works perfectly on your website. Before we begin, you should know that the theme&#8217;s performance depends on many factors like the host performance, server configuration, and the number of visitors.</p>
<h2 class="td-new-separator">Server requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>WordPress 4.0 or later</li>
<li>Apache or Nginx</li>
<li>php.ini memory limit: 64MB (recommended: 96M)</li>
<li>PHP version 7.0 or greater</li>
<li>MySQL version 5.0 or greater (recommended: MySQL 5.5 or greater)</li>
<li>The mod_rewrite Apache module (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>For optimal performance, the server requires some settings to be made, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use of a cache plugin &#8211; we recommend <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache</a></li>
<li>PageSpeed optimization &#8211; we created a guide for this <a href="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-increase-page-loading-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="td-new-separator">Hosting requirement</h2>
<p>As a general rule, if WordPress performs fine on your host, the theme should, too. Next, we present you a list of common hosts and the traffic you can expect to host on them.</p>
<p>Please note that the numbers quoted here do not represent a guarantee, as the hosting performance depends on your WordPress configuration, plugin configuration, and general OS configuration. All numbers assume that you use a caching plugin like<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/"> WP Super Cache</a>. Also, a CDN solution like <a href="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-set-up-cloudflare-cdn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare</a> should help you a lot.</p>
<p><b>GoDaddy or another cheap shared hosting:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Should handle 1- 2,000 unique users per day</li>
<li>Will not handle traffic spikes well</li>
<li>Use, if possible, a small number of plugins</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Budget VPS:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Should handle 2,000 &#8211; 4,000 unique users per day</li>
<li>Will not handle traffic spikes well</li>
<li>Get as much RAM as possible</li>
</ul>
<p><b>High-performance VPS:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Should handle 4,000 &#8211; 6,000 unique users per day</li>
<li>Should be with more than 4GB of RAM</li>
<li>If properly configured, with enough RAM, and also with a swap partition, the server should handle traffic spikes</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Dedicated server:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Should handle 6,000+ unique users per day</li>
<li>On dedicated servers and with that traffic number, it&#8217;s recommended using at least 8 GB of RAM</li>
<li>It should handle traffic spikes well</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="td-ss-parameters-guide" class="td-new-separator">System status parameters guide</h2>
<p>Our themes include a special section called System Status. Here you can check if the server and WordPress parameters are set for optimal performance. In this guide, we cover the recommended configuration of those parameters.</p>
<h2>I) WP-Config settings</h2>
<p>The wp-config.php file is located in the WordPress root directory.</p>
<p><strong>WP Memory Limit:</strong></p>
<p>This parameter sets the amount of memory used by PHP and by default, WordPress can go up to 40MB. To avoid “Memory Exhausted” error, this parameter should be set to at least 256MB, and you can do this from the WordPress wp-config.php file.</p>
<pre>define( 'WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M' );</pre>
<p><strong>WP Debug:</strong></p>
<p>It is an option intended for development, and it controls the reporting of some errors and warnings. It may display unwanted messages so you should disable it on your side. The default value is <tt>false</tt>.</p>
<pre>define('WP_DEBUG', false);</pre>
<h4><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5036 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/set-wep-debug.jpg" alt="Newspaper Theme Requirements: WP Config" width="1200" height="893" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/set-wep-debug.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/set-wep-debug-300x223.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/set-wep-debug-768x572.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/set-wep-debug-1024x762.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/set-wep-debug-80x60.jpg 80w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/set-wep-debug-265x198.jpg 265w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/set-wep-debug-485x360.jpg 485w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/set-wep-debug-696x518.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/set-wep-debug-1068x795.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/set-wep-debug-564x420.jpg 564w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></h4>
<h2>II) Missing PHP extensions</h2>
<p>The Newspaper Theme requires <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php">GD Library</a> and <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/mbstring.installation.php">mbstring</a> PHP extensions that can be enabled on the server.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5730 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gd_library_mbstring.jpg" alt="newspaper theme requirements" width="1200" height="521" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gd_library_mbstring.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gd_library_mbstring-300x130.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gd_library_mbstring-768x333.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gd_library_mbstring-1024x445.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gd_library_mbstring-696x302.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gd_library_mbstring-1068x464.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gd_library_mbstring-967x420.jpg 967w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>The procedure required for enabling these extensions depends on your operating system. In the following lines we cover this procedure for Windows, Linux with C-Panel and Linux dedicated servers:</p>
<p><strong>Windows:</strong><br />
1) Edit php.ini and search for the following lines:</p>
<pre>;extension=php_mbstring.dll
;extension=php_gd2.dll
</pre>
<p>2) Remove the “;” sign that appears at the beginning of each line</p>
<p>3) Save php.ini and restart Apache</p>
<p><strong>Linux C-Panel:</strong><br />
1) Go to <strong>C-Panel &gt; Software &gt; Select PHP version/ PHP Manager / PHP editor</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/php-manager.jpg" alt="Newspaper Theme Requirements" width="845" height="281" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/php-manager.jpg 845w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/php-manager-300x100.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/php-manager-768x255.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/php-manager-696x231.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" /></p>
<p>2) Now, choose the PHP version you want to use, and the extensions panel should show up below. Press the &#8220;Set as current&#8221; button and wait until &#8220;Current PHP version&#8221; matches your selected one. Next, make sure that the GD and mbstring extensions are checked. Press the &#8220;Save&#8221; button located at the bottom-left corner to save the settings.<img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5731 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cpanel.jpg" alt="Newspaper Theme Requirements" width="1200" height="643" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cpanel.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cpanel-300x161.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cpanel-768x412.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cpanel-1024x549.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cpanel-696x373.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cpanel-1068x572.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cpanel-784x420.jpg 784w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p><strong>Linux dedicated server:</strong><br />
1) Connect to the server using SSH. Depending on your Linux distribution and the version of PHP you&#8217;re using, enter the following commands:</p>
<pre>## Ubuntu PHP5 ##
#sudo apt-get install php5-gd
#sudo apt-get install php5-mbstring

## Ubuntu PHP7 ## 
#sudo apt-get install php7.0-gd 
#sudo apt-get install php7.0-mbstring 

## Centos PHP5 ## 
#sudo yum install php5-gd 
#sudo yum install php5-mbstring

## Centos PHP7 ## 
#sudo yum install php7.0-gd 
#sudo yum install php7.0-mbstring
</pre>
<h2>III) Php.ini parameters</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>max_input_vars</b> &#8211; This sets how many input variables may be accepted (limit is applied to $_GET, $_POST and $_COOKIE superglobal separately). By default, this parameter is set to 1000, and this may cause issues when saving the menu. We recommend that you increase it to 2000 or more.</li>
<li><b>max_execution_time</b> &#8211; This sets the maximum time (in seconds) a script is allowed to run before the parser terminates it. The theme demos download images from our servers and depending on the connection speed this process may require a longer time to execute. We recommend that you should increase it 60 or more.</li>
<li><b>post_max_size</b> &#8211; Sets the maximum size of the post data allowed. This setting also affects file upload.</li>
<li><b>upload_max_filesize</b> &#8211;  To upload large files, like plugins .zip files, you also have to increase this value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the host, these parameters can be set from php.ini or .htaccess:</p>
<p>php.ini</p>
<pre>max_input_vars = 5000
max_execution_time = 300
post_max_size = 50M
upload_max_filesize = 50M</pre>
<p>.hthaccess</p>
<pre>php_value max_input_vars 5000
php_value max_execution_time 300
php_value post_max_size 50M
php_value upload_max_filesize 50M
</pre>
<p><b>Note &#8211;</b> Before trying any of those, please check the host documentation to see what&#8217;s the recommended method. The location of the php.ini may also differ from one server to the other. Usually, it&#8217;s in the WordPress root, but, on some servers, it may be found in another location. You have to check the host documentation for more precise details.</p>
<h3 class="td-new-separator">Suhosin</h3>
<p>Suhosin is an advanced protection system for PHP installations. It was designed to protect servers and users from known and unknown flaws in PHP applications and the PHP core. If it&#8217;s installed on your host, you have to increase the <b>suhosin.post.max_vars</b> and <b>suhosin.request.max_vars</b> parameters to 2000 or more.</p>
<p>php.ini</p>
<pre>suhosin.request.max_vars = 5000
suhosin.post.max_vars = 5000</pre>
<p>.htaccess</p>
<pre>php_value suhosin.post.max_vars 5000
php_value suhosin.request.max_vars 5000</pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong> &#8211; You don&#8217;t have to modify these parameters if Suhosin is not installed on your host.</p>
<h3 id="td-mod-substitute">mod_substitute</h3>
<p>If Apache&#8217;s mod_substitute module is active on your server you can get the following warning in the theme &#8220;System status&#8221; section:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-4753 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tagdiv-installation-mod-substitue.jpg" alt="Newspaper Theme Requirements: mod_substitute" width="1200" height="507" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tagdiv-installation-mod-substitue.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tagdiv-installation-mod-substitue-300x127.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tagdiv-installation-mod-substitue-768x324.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tagdiv-installation-mod-substitue-1024x433.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tagdiv-installation-mod-substitue-696x294.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tagdiv-installation-mod-substitue-1068x451.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tagdiv-installation-mod-substitue-994x420.jpg 994w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>In some cases, the mod_substitute module default configuration may cause a timeout error on tagDiv Composer when loading large pages. To fix this, you have to add the following lines in the .htaccess file located in your website main folder:</p>
<p>.htaccess</p>
<pre>&lt;IfModule mod_substitute.c&gt;
SubstituteMaxLineLength 10M
&lt;/IfModule&gt;

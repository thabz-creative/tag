										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With over 5 million active installations, WooCommerce is the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/">most popular eCommerce </a>plugin and has always been compatible with the Newspaper template. For example, some websites sell a few items and keep a blog to highlight their products and share news about them. Other websites are entire tech portals that sell gadgets. Starting with <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-11/">Newspaper version 11</a>, our news theme has become more WooCommerce friendly due to the new. We’ve added new, useful shortcodes and features for WooCommerce ready for you to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-what-are-woocommerce-shortcodes">What are WooCommerce shortcodes?</h3>



<p>WooCommerce shortcodes are pieces of code that you can easily insert into your posts or pages that bring eCommerce functionality. There are a few mandatory tools that must be always included in your site: shop, cart, related products, an easy-to-use filtering system, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="588" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page.jpg" alt="Create the Picture Perfect Layout for your Front Page Shop" class="wp-image-16833" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-300x147.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-1024x502.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-768x376.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-696x341.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-1068x523.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<p>Once you install WooCommerce on your site, you’ll notice that it comes with some pre-built shortcodes with the possibility to<a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/"> purchase more Woo extensions</a> and enlarge the plugin’s capabilities. However, starting with the Newspaper theme 11 update, we’ve added a new premium plugin called tagDiv Shop which is mandatory to run Shop Cloud Templates and extensive features compatible with the WooCommerce plugin. Furthermore, with the tagDiv Shop activated, you can install one of the Prebuilt eShop Websites our design team has carefully built. If you need help to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezaaE2VP7V8">install a prebuilt website design</a>, you can follow along with our video tutorial.</p>



<h2 id="h-tagdiv-shop-brings-woocommerce-functionality">tagDiv Shop Brings WooCommerce functionality</h2>



<p>We’ve crafted a dedicated plugin that brings you all the eCommerce functionality you would possibly need to run an online store.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-let-s-tackle-the-tagdiv-shop-elements">Let’s tackle the tagDiv Shop elements</h3>



<p>You’ll find the Woo elements divided into three major sections in the tagDiv Composer page builder:</p>



<ol><li>WooCommerce shortcodes that are specific to the Woo Template you are currently editing.</li><li>WooCommerce common shortcodes that can be used interchangeably on any Woo Template.</li><li>Block shortcodes &#8211; the Woo Product Block. This element can also be used on homepage, product, and category pages and you can easily add filters on it.</li></ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The homepage is the core of your website. It’s the starting point of the audience’s journey through your website, storage of vital links and data, a strategic asset for marketing goals. Most often, the homepage is the first visual and emotional touch that visitors have with your content and products. Fortunately, building homepages with Newspaper Theme is easy as a game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5114 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper.jpg" alt="Homepages with Newspaper Theme" width="1200" height="500" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-300x125.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-768x320.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-1024x427.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-696x290.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-1068x445.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-1008x420.jpg 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Homepages with Newspaper Theme</h2>
<p>If you’re creating your first website, remember to use clear structures for their homepages. Here are some important elements you can add to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headline &#8211; a short statement that reflects what the website’s all about</li>
<li>A hero element with simple imagery that should inspire your visitors to interact further</li>
<li>Call-to-action that draws the attention and uses active language</li>
<li>Present your blog content through Flex Grids and Blocks</li>
<li><a href="https://tagdiv.com/newsletter-plugin/">Newsletter subscription box</a> to attract more readers to follow and keep up-to-date with your content</li>
<li>Good navigation elements such as links in the menu to take the users easily across the website, a search function, and social network buttons</li>
<li>Testimonials to increase your credibility</li>
<li>A section with team members to help readers build an emotional connection with you</li>
</ul>
<p>These are popular elements for any Homepage. However, it should not be a limit to you, as you can always add more sections and items. Homepages with Newspaper Theme? The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p><video class="td-center td-article-img-border" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="1200" height="632"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source type="video/mp4" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Homepage.mp4"></video></p>
<h2>Homepage Templates</h2>
<p>Your goals are essential when you start out. Do you want to dabble in e-commerce? Are you going to use the site as a blog? Or, maybe, showcase your portfolio of works and creative products. You should know the answer before starting the process and design the website to best serve that purpose.</p>
<p>Newspaper Theme offers a variety of Homepage designs to choose from to begin easily. From the WordPress Admin Dashboard, open the Cloud Templates section and click on the “Add New” button. You will be greeted with a digital library of our designers’ creations, with over a thousand templates; from Article, Author, and <a href="https://tagdiv.com/find-whats-new-category-templates/">Category Page Templates</a> to <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introducing-new-404-page-templates/">404 Page Error ones</a>, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Choose the Homepage tab and scroll down to see each design. Click on the one that catches your eye to see a live preview of it, or import it directly to your website. After the import is over, &nbsp;make it a part of your vision! Edit and customize each element to your heart’s desire and create something brand new.</p>
<h2>Make your Custom Homepage</h2>
<p>In your Admin Dashboard, navigate to the Pages section and click on the “Add New” button. Give the page a title such as Index or Homepage. Save the page. Press the “tagDiv Composer” button to access the front-end editing section.</p>
<p>Let’s make an efficient yet beautiful Homepage. Add a Hero Element by dragging and dropping it onto the blank page. The item has a default appearance and settings, so click on it to open the settings and customize it to perfection! Write a short description of your site’s purpose and draw the readers in through a short Title.</p>
<p><video class="td-center td-article-img-border" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="1200" height="686"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source type="video/mp4" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Create-your-own-homepage-with-Newspaper-Theme.mp4"></video></p>
<p>For content-heavy websites, the general advice is to add a Flex Grid and Flex Block to display all of your relevant posts and articles. However, the decision is in your hands.</p>
<p>If you want to interact with your audience further, add a Row with the Team Member Element. This gives you the possibility to showcase everyone contributing to your website, from authors to designers. Include a description for each member to allow the visitors to build an emotional connection with you.</p>
<h2>Creation, design, perfection</h2>
<p>Keep the layout nice and simple. Here’s a tip: create gaps between sections using white space to help your visitors navigate through the page easily. Add relevant information on the homepage such as a small showcase of your products, testimonials from clients, ads to monetize your site, buttons that invite your readers to engage further. The sky is the limit on what you can create!</p>
<p>Each element that you add on the page with the tagDiv Composer can be clicked on to customize even further. Choose font families in accordance with your vision. Color palettes are great to maintain through each page and the entire website.</p>
<p>For example, for a non-profit organization whose goal is to stop deforestation, their site’s color palette could be browns and greens to inspire the idea of trees and nature. Think of a travel beach resort website. They might use blues and yellows to represent the sun and the blue summer sky and help you immerse yourself in the dream vacation they want to portray. So, pick them to serve your goal.</p>

<h2>Invest your creativity into your Homepage</h2>
<p>If you either build the homepage from the ground up or use one from the Cloud Library and modify it to fit your website’s core, <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609">Newspaper Theme</a> brings you countless customization possibilities. Design and create any layout for the page to connect and engage with your audience.</p>
<p>With an amazing user experience, any homepage is successful. So design the homepages with Newspaper Theme based on a good interaction between your visitors and your site. Show us in the comments what your Homepage looks like and be an inspiration for the whole community! ?</p>

<p>With the new way of creating mobile pages, you’ll definitely have the most appealing and fully-functional website. The freedom of customizing mobile pages to your liking will boost your UX and UI results. It’s the same website, but whole new experience for your visitors. It is not enough to ensure a responsive and adaptive website design that automatically resizes the content of a page or post. Starting with the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-10-3-7/">Newspaper 10.3.7 version</a>, you can mix and match elements for the mobile pages live, right on the frontend of your site.</p>



<h2>How to Create a Mobile Page with tagDiv Composer</h2>



<p>If you want to create a new mobile page, you first have to go on the website’s frontend and choose a particular page or template to edit. The main functionality of the new mobile page system can be found at the top of the screen, near the “<span style="background-color:#00a364" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Edit with TagDiv Composer</span>” tab, and it is called “<span style="background-color:#1c1d1e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Mobile Page</span> .” Here’s an example of how this should look:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="466" height="150" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/no-mobile-page-2.png" alt="No Mobile Page" class="wp-image-14294" title="" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/no-mobile-page-2.png 466w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/no-mobile-page-2-300x97.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /></figure></div>



<p>If you click on the “Mobile Page No mobile page” tab and the page does not have a mobile version, then it will appear the following message &#8220;<strong><em>No mobile page, please import or create a new mobile page</em></strong>&#8220;<strong> </strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="510" height="335" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/copy-content.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14296" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/copy-content.jpg 510w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/copy-content-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></figure></div>



<p>A new mobile page can be created by pressing the + icon at the right of the mobile page section. The newly created mobile page is blank by default, but you can check the <span style="background-color:#b5dcaf" class="td_text_highlight_marker"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span>Copy Content box below the mobile page name and hit the Create button. This option is going to copy the whole desktop content and paste it automatically into the new mobile page for easier content manipulation. Then, if you’ll open the dropdown, all the existing mobile pages for this page in particular will appear one beneath the other.</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14298" width="250" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page.jpg 1920w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-300x170.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-768x436.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-1536x871.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-696x395.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-1068x606.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption>Click the Create Mobile Page button from the tagDiv Composer front-end pagebuilder. The Button is right beneath your Save Settings.</figcaption></figure></div></a></div>



<p>Furthermore, if you’re currently editing a page with the tagDiv Composer page builder, you can easily build a mobile template or just edit it. Below the tagDiv Composer menu, you have the page breadcrumbs, and two important sections called <span style="background-color:#c4cdd1" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Edit&nbsp;</span>and <span style="background-color:#c4cdd1" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Create Mobile Template</span></p>



<p>All the mobile templates that you’ve created can be found in the WordPress Admin Dashboard; you’ll see the mobile pages in the pages sections, and the mobile templates in the &nbsp;<span style="background-color:#2665b6" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Cloud Templates.</span></p>



<p>If you open the backend of your Newspaper website and navigate to the Pages area, you’ll see two new columns added. The Mobile Page column shows if a particular page or template has a mobile page assigned or not to it, while the Mobile Template column informs you what type of page it is (mobile or not).</p>



<h2>How to Edit The Mobile Pages</h2>



<p>If you are on the frontend of your website and open a specific page, you have to navigate to the top of the page and click on the “<span style="background-color:#373d40" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Mobile Page</span> ” tab to open the dropdown. When you hover over the wanted template, you can edit the mobile page by using the <strong>small pencil button</strong> next to the mobile page name. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="468" height="163" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-the-pencil-icon-to-edit-the-page-1.png" alt="Click the Pencil Icon to edit" class="wp-image-14307" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-the-pencil-icon-to-edit-the-page-1.png 468w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-the-pencil-icon-to-edit-the-page-1-300x104.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></figure></div>



<p>Once you press the pencil button, you will be redirected to tagDiv Composer in the editing mode. From here you can add, remove, and adjust the block elements you want to show on your mobile pages.</p>



<h2>Header and Footer for Mobile Pages</h2>



<p>Every website should have a top and bottom area. This is the nicest way to say hello and say goodbye to your visitors. Headers and footers on mobile devices should be just as appealing as the ones from your website’s desktop versions. With Newspaper Theme and the Website Manager within the tagDiv Composer page builder it’s easy to select or import a header and footer for your new mobile page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1089" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr.png" alt="Website Manager" class="wp-image-14328" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr.png 1920w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-300x170.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-1024x581.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-768x436.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-1536x871.png 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-696x395.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-1068x606.png 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>

<p>Are you looking to start a blog to share with your friends, family, and build a supportive online community? The new Mintyside PRO demo is the perfect blend of simplicity and minimalism that is not only user-friendly but also allows you to focus on creating content. Write about interesting topics, create eye-catching titles, and let Newspaper Theme handle the full website’s design &amp; its functionality.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="843" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into.jpg" alt="Mintyside PRO demo Homepage into" class="wp-image-13933" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-300x211.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-1024x719.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-768x540.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-696x489.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-1068x750.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Mintyside PRO: intro</h2>



<p>A blog can be anything from reporting on the latest trending topics (celebrities, politics, entertainment, finance, news coverage), delivering trusted information to technological and scientific developments. Even more, you can keep a daily blog as a recollection of memories, experiences, and tutorials for readers to enjoy. The Newspaper Mintyside PRO demo allows you to turn your website into the blog of your dreams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a wide-set layout, a grey background that goes perfectly with the turquoise accent colors, it embodies a feeling of freshness and energy. Combining a sans-serif font with a serif one and dividing the page into three columns, it leaves the viewers feeling like they’re reading an actual physical newspaper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By importing your featured images and content, your articles will be the center of the homepage. Monetizing your blog should also be a breeze with the Newspaper Theme’s <a href="https://tagdiv.com/ad-box-newspaper-theme/">ad box</a> and Newsletter subscription block. Award your long-time readers and entice the new ones to subscribe and send them weekly notifications about your most important blog posts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="641" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles.jpg" alt="Mintyside PRO demo Related Articles" class="wp-image-13934" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-300x160.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-1024x547.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-768x410.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-696x372.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-1068x570.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Breeze along</h2>



<p>Mintyside PRO demo gives you options to show off your content in different manners<a href="https://tagdiv.com/header-main-menu-newspaper-theme/">, the header main menu</a><strong> </strong>is set perfectly for not only mega menu with subcategories, simple mega menu, and even submenus. With dashed borders on hover and shadows for blocks, the demo highlights both the menu and the search bar.</p>



<p>With white rows upon a grey background, headings, excerpts, and categories, the Mintyside PRO demo makes it easier for you to build a brand and share amazing stories with the world. Each featured image can become part of a segment you want to push forward: color schemes, color theory, illustrations, photography, and more.</p>



<h2>Installing Mintyside PRO demo</h2>



<p>Version 10.3.6 of Newspaper Theme came bundled up with<a href="https://tagdiv.com/embrace-summer-with-five-new-pro-demos-newspaper-theme/"> various new demos</a>: Magazine PRO, Lifestyle PRO, Scuba PRO, Retro Blog PRO, and Mintyside PRO. Owning a copy of Newspaper Theme gives you access to all these new demos by simply updating it. If you need more information about that, there’s an in-depth tutorial on <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introduction-to-newspaper-theme-automatic-updates/">how to update your Newspaper Theme.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="652" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1.jpg" alt="Mintyside PRO demo Single Post Template" class="wp-image-13936" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-300x163.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-1024x556.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-768x417.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-696x378.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-1068x580.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>To install the Mintyside PRO demo, you need to access your WordPress Admin Dashboard. From there, navigate to Newspaper Theme &gt; Install Demos. Scroll down the page to find the one you’re looking for and hover over it to choose between:</p>



<ul><li>Design Only lets you import only the templates, colors, fonts, homepage.</li><li>With content comes with all the sample content: the categories and posts are included in the import.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The main difference between the two of them is the fact that once you uninstall the demo and install another one, the sample content (categories &amp; posts) are also removed from the website. If you already have content of your own, it’s best to go with “Design Only.”</p>



<h2>Header Adjustments</h2>



<p>One of the first things you should do after installing the demo is to make changes that showcase your brand and what the blog’s all about. Go to the homepage and open it through the tagDiv Composer. In the header section, click on the Logo element and upload your pre-designed logo as an image, copy and paste it as a SVG code or even create a new one with text and fonts.</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo.jpg" alt="Edit the Logo" class="wp-image-13943" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo.jpg 1890w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-300x145.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-1024x495.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-768x371.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-1536x742.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-696x336.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-1068x516.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1890px) 100vw, 1890px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>The next item on the agenda is the main menu. Click on it, and from the General Settings tab, choose a menu you’ve created using the WordPress widget. You can always create a new one from the Admin Dashboard &gt; Appearance &gt; Menus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scroll down the page to change the logo and menu for the sticky header, too. And last but not least, using the device bar of the tagDiv Composer, click on the mobile view and change the logo and menu for the mobile device and mobile sticky.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="642" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template.jpg" alt="Author Template Mintyside PRO" class="wp-image-13937" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-300x161.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-1024x548.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-768x411.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-696x372.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-1068x571.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Let’s tackle the Homepage</h2>



<p>When you open the page with the tagDiv Composer you need to filter or offset Flex Blocks. To do this, click on one of them and travel to the Filter tabs. Now, sort the articles by author, categories, tags, or even by ID. From the General Tab, you can add an offset by inputting a number in the box.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the right column, you have an ad box that can show your affiliates’ ad image. Upload the photo you want to use in the Image ad tab and write the URL. Scrolling down, you have more Flex Blocks elements and a Subscription box, and to the left side of it, a Background Image set on column. The background image can be replaced by navigating to the Column &gt; CSS tab and then choosing a different image.&nbsp;</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1.jpg" alt="Edit the Subscription Box" class="wp-image-13945" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1.jpg 1797w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-300x134.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-1024x456.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-768x342.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-1536x685.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-696x310.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-1068x476.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1797px) 100vw, 1797px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>The subscription box also needs your <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newsletter-plugin/">Mailchimp / Feedburner / MailerLite</a> code. From the General tab, choose your provider and copy-paste the embedded code in the box. Right below this, you have another ad box that you can replace with a different image and URL. The rest of the page only contains one more flex block and a Posts Loop. The Flex block can be filtered or offsetted according to what you wish to show. Save your settings!</p>



<h2>Templates</h2>



<p>The most important part of adjusting your <a href="https://tagdiv.com/what-is-the-cloud-library/">Cloud Library Templates </a>is to showcase different articles through the flex blocks used on them. And just like above, you can filter or offset them. This applies to all the templates, so just hit the “Edit Template” button and make your adjustments.</p>



<p>Moreover, on the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introducing-new-404-page-templates/">404 Template</a>, you need to add a URL that leads back to your homepage. So just copy and paste the website’s link to the button. The Author and Single Post Template have an ad box that needs to be replaced, too. Once you’re done, save your settings!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Market your site’s originality</h2>



<p>If you want to change the demo’s layout, colors, fonts, you need a plan in mind. Take a look at our<strong> </strong><a href="https://tagdiv.com/typography-guide-101-basics-tips-ideas-inspiration/">typography guide </a>to understand the basics of contrast, tracking, and font-weight. Then choose fonts that are web-safe from the online gallery of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Fonts</a>. Now when you open a page or template through the tagDiv Composer, you can easily alter the fonts by going into the “Style” tab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For colors, you need a primary and an accent color to create contrast and highlight important items. To better understand color complementaries, monochromatic and analogous schemes, you should learn the basics of<strong> </strong><a href="https://tagdiv.com/color-theory-newspaper-theme/">Color Theory.</a> With a color palette in mind, replace the colors on your templates and pages using the Style tab of the elements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And last but not least, the magical tagDiv Composer allows you to make any layout alterations you need. They all can be done on the front-end by dragging and dropping items in the desired order. Create new rows, columns, adjust paddings, margins, and even borders. Once you have everything perfectly aligned, save your settings!</p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>Whether you want to modify the demo to fit your vision or not, Mintyside PRO is capable of adapting to any type of blog. Everything can be adjusted right on the frontend, without any HTML or CSS skills/knowledge, so building your site is a breeze. Newspaper Theme’s PRO demos are entirely customizable from top to bottom. Once you hit that install demo button, the layout is perfect from the get-go! And remember, content is king.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ready to start a blog? Become the frontrunner of a locally-brought news source or just share your insights on new technology. Show stories from all around the world with a beautiful website design. Newspaper Theme 10.3.3 released 6 new demos that are meant to stun and wow the audience. One of which is the dark yet cozy-looking PRO demo AmberLight. Let’s explore all that it has to offer and why you should consider installing it on your website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="587" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero.jpg" alt="AmberLight PRO Demo hero" class="wp-image-13479" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-300x147.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-1024x501.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-768x376.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-696x340.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-1068x522.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>AmberLight: intro</h2>



<p>Emboldened by a dark background, the text and images will stand out among each page and template with AmberLight PRO. As such, your blog can deliver the content the viewers want to read in an enjoyable fashion. Combining the warm tones of yellow with turquoise and a dark green-blue, the site gets modernized while maintaining a level of comfort in aspect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bright neon turquoise tends to slip on the cyberpunk color scheme and gives the page’s elements a retro-futuristic vibe. Take advantage of this accent color as it seamlessly blends with a website focused on technological advancements. Moreover, the amber hue plays an essential role in warming up the entire layout. Contrasting widely against the cool-shades of turquoise, the golden tones are perfect for any type of blog.</p>



<h2>Taking a Dive into the Deep-End</h2>



<p>As we’ve previously seen, each <a href="https://tagdiv.com/geometric-web-design-newspaper-theme/">geometric shape has its own meaning</a>. Any element that is rounded and has no sharp edges represents harmony and safety. Consequently, AmberLight PRO demo follows that theory as each item has a curved smooth surface. Moreover, according to <a href="https://uxmovement.com/thinking/why-rounded-corners-are-easier-on-the-eyes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UX Movement</a>, while sharp corners take away focus from inside a rectangle, rounded corners place the viewer’s attention inside it.</p>



<p>Another different pair, just like the color scheme, are the shapes which appear in the design. Taking away from mathematical equations, we have polar opposites: the plus and minus sign, which are predominant throughout the demo. Of course, the last polarity of the layout is the hover effect of any feature post image, which turns black and white. By taking away the color of the photo, the feature crosses into another contrasting threshold. It marks the dissimilitude between monochromatic and colorful.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="529" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles.jpg" alt="Featured Articles AmberLight" class="wp-image-13480" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-300x132.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-1024x451.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-768x339.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-696x307.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-1068x471.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Installing AmberLight PRO</h2>



<p>When you update the Newspaper Theme to the latest version, you get access to all the recent features and PRO demos. Version 10.3.3 comes packed with 6 new demos, one of which is AmberLight PRO. If you’re new to WordPress, we have a helpful article on <a href="https://tagdiv.com/update-newspaper-theme/">how to update Newspaper Theme</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the Admin Dashboard, go to Newspaper Theme &gt; Install Demos. You can look for AmberLight on the side column, which shows a list of all the possible demos you can install, or scroll down the page to the featured demo image. When hovering over the demo’s photo, the <strong>Install </strong>button pops up. Moreover, right next to it, there&#8217;s a switch that allows you to import the entire demo’s articles, categories, menu items, images, and links.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your website has no content, and you want to test out how AmberLight would look, install it by letting the demo “Include Content.”&nbsp; However, if you’ve already started publishing articles and posts, flip the switch over to “Design only.” This option installs the demo without actually adding the articles and posts. Because when you uninstall a demo, it will delete all the categories and posts it came with.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="339" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/footer.jpg" alt="AmberLight PRO footer" class="wp-image-13488" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/footer.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/footer-300x85.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/footer-1024x289.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/footer-768x217.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/footer-696x197.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/footer-1068x302.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Header &amp; Footer</h2>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo.jpg" alt="AmberLight PRO change the logo name" class="wp-image-13481" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo.jpg 1582w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-300x143.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-1024x487.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-768x366.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-1536x731.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-696x331.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-1068x508.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1582px) 100vw, 1582px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>When first installing a demo, you need to make some changes to truly showcase your website. For starters, if you’re new to using the tagDiv Composer we advise you to check out the<a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/"> basic tips and tricks</a> for our frontend page builder. Now open the homepage using the tagDiv Composer and click on the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/create-a-logo-with-newspaper-theme/">Header Logo</a>. In the General Settings tab, scroll down to the “Text” section and write your website’s name inside the text and tagline boxes. Whichever word you input in the text box will be white, while the tagline will be golden. Upon hover, the colors will switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Save the settings. Go to the Admin Dashboard then to &gt; Appearance &gt; Menus. If you have already created a menu with pages, items, categories, and various other links, you can skip this step. If that&#8217;s not the case, then start dragging the homepage, and any categories you want to showcase. Make items mega menu elements or even create sub-menus. If you need more information about that, check out our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/header-main-menu-newspaper-theme/">main menu article</a>. Save the created menu, then open the tagDiv Composer on your homepage again. Click on the Main Menu item and choose your predefined menu in the drop-down list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Repeat these steps for the mobile menu by going to the Website Manager button in the top left corner of your tagDiv Composer and clicking on the mobile view. When you finish, scroll down to the bottom of the page and choose 3 different list menus for the footer. Change your Header Logo here, too, and finally: Save!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="880" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks.jpg" alt="Homepage Flex Blocks" class="wp-image-13490" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-300x220.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-1024x751.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-768x563.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-696x510.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-1068x783.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Homepage Adjustments</h2>



<p>If the frontend page builder is still open on the homepage, let’s take this moment to make some further adjustments. Click on the first Flex Block on the page. When importing the demo, it will display your latest posts but you can go to its Filter settings tab and choose to display a preferred category. The next Flex Block on the page can show a different category, or if you want, just add an offset so that it skips over the first few posts. Go to the General tab and add a number in the Offset Posts box. Great! Now continue filtering the rest of the Flex Blocks for the page.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the ad that appears on this page. Click on it and go to the Image Ad tab. This is where you upload an affiliate’s photo. Moreover, copy-paste the affiliate’s link in the Ad URL box. If you want to use Google Ads, go to the Custom Ad tab and input the code there. You’re done! Save the settings.</p>



<h2>Templates &amp; Contact Page</h2>



<p>The steps you’ve taken above can be applied for the rest of the templates of the website, as well. Edit them by going to the Admin Dashboard &gt; Cloud Templates and choosing which one to start &gt; Edit Template. This should open the template with tagDiv Composer using sample content. If you want a live preview of it, however, just navigate to where it’s used. For example, for single Post Templates, open an article and hit the “Edit Template” button on your admin bar.&nbsp;</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url.jpg" alt="Change the button's URL" class="wp-image-13485" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url.jpg 1600w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-300x155.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-1024x530.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-768x397.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-1536x795.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-696x360.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-1068x553.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>AmberLight PRO has a straightforward and direct layout design. So, all you need to do for most templates is filter Flex Blocks to display different posts and adjust codes for your Ad Boxes. The only template that needs something else done to it is the 404 Template. It contains a button that needs a link back to the homepage. Click on the button through the tagDiv Composer, and go to the General Settings tab. In the “Button URL” box type in your website’s address. Save!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="767" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page.jpg" alt="AmberLight Contact Page" class="wp-image-13494" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-300x192.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-1024x655.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-768x491.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-696x445.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-1068x683.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Contact Page</h2>



<p>The demo also comes with its very own contact page that you can edit to your liking. Let’s go to the frontend page builder and see what needs to be edited. The first item that needs adjustment is the button: it needs a link just like the 404 Template one. Add a link to your email address using the “mailto:emailaddress” form.&nbsp;</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress.jpg" alt="Add your email address for the button" class="wp-image-13493" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress.jpg 1600w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-300x146.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-768x373.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-1536x746.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-696x338.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-1068x519.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>Let’s check out the next element, which is a text element. All you need to do for this one is to insert your personal contact information replacing the sample one. Push the “Edit Content” button from the element’s General Settings tab. Now write your correct addresses and numbers. Great! Right below this item is a social links one. Click on it and add your precise social media usernames.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And last but not least, this element is a Flex Block. Filter it by a favorite category or add an offset to adjust what posts you want to show, and you’re done! Save.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Make AmberLight personal</h2>



<p>Just as you’ve made the last few edits to each template and page the demo has, you can make a lot more! Whether you want to adjust fonts or colors to match your website’s core vision or add new images to the contact and 404 pages, the frontend&nbsp; tagDiv Composer builder makes everything effortless and intuitive.</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal.jpg" alt="Make the demo yours!" class="wp-image-13497" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal.jpg 1600w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal-300x192.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal-1024x654.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal-768x491.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal-1536x981.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal-696x445.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal-1068x682.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>If you already have a color palette you want to stick to, change both the row’s background color and text colors. Links, hovers, buttons, anything can be modified. Just click on any item you want to change and go to its style or CSS tab. In fact, the newest version of the Newspaper Theme has a search bar function. Just type in “color” to see exactly what you need marked by a red dot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go through each page and template and gradually turn the demo into something stunning that wows your audience. Don’t forget to save consistently!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="651" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/author-page.jpg" alt="AmberLight Author Page" class="wp-image-13496" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/author-page.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/author-page-300x163.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/author-page-1024x556.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/author-page-768x417.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/author-page-696x378.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/author-page-1068x579.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>Whether you want to create a striking contrast by using AmberLight PRO or just build something new from the ground up, each adjustment made should match your vision. With rounded corners, yellow highlights in opposition to the cooler tones of turquoise, grayscale hover featured images all of these upon a dark background make up precisely what makes AmberLight stand out. Explore each feature, each factor that contributes to it by installing it and showcasing your website down below!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guide on how to install and configure the WP Super Cache plugin</p>
<p>A cache plugin generates static pages and improves the site page speed. The cached pages are stored in the memory. When a user makes a request, the process&nbsp;skips&nbsp;the PHP execution and the database requests and delivers&nbsp;the&nbsp;pages from the cache.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to WP-Admin area, open the Plugins -&gt; Add new section. Press on the Upload Plugin</li>
<li>Use the search bar to look for WP Super Cache and install the plugin.</li>

<h2>WP Super Cache Plugin configuration:</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wanted to showcase your photos in a delightful way? With a unique design and light-box feature, this amazing tagDiv Slide Gallery was built to enhance your articles’ value. Moreover, it can accommodate a different aspect ratio, and also each image displays a description and the copyright information.</p>
<h2>The tagDiv Slide Gallery</h2>
<p>First things first, to display the thumbnails of the feature, you need to have them enabled in the Newspaper Theme Panel. Go to your WordPress Admin Dashboard &gt; Newspaper Theme Panel &gt; Block Settings. Under “Thumbs on modules and blocks,” enable the 80 x 60 thumbs and 0 x 420. With these settings on, we can start creating our gallery.</p>
<p>Add a new post through the WordPress Admin Dashboard or click on an already written article and edit it. If you want to give your articles a personalized look, import a Single Post Template or create one from scratch using the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/what-is-the-cloud-library/">tagDiv Cloud Library</a>. You can then select to use the template for the post you’re editing by selecting it in the “Post Settings.” For more information, check out <a href="https://tagdiv.com/customize-articles-with-single-post-templates/">this blog post.</a></p>
<p><iframe class="td-extend-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SU35E8hq9ME" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>How to create an image tagDiv Slide Gallery?</h2>
<p>Open the article, and insert a “Classic” element through your Gutenberg editor. Then press the small “Add Media” button.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6102 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery1.jpg" alt="tagDiv Slide Gallery" width="1200" height="294" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery1.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery1-300x74.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery1-768x188.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery1-1024x251.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery1-696x171.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery1-1068x262.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Click the “Create Gallery” section. When it opens up, select all the images you want to display. Don’t worry, you can always come back and edit it later. Now press the “Create a new Gallery” to travel to a different window.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6103 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery2.jpg" alt="tagDiv Slide Gallery" width="1200" height="429" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery2.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery2-300x107.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery2-768x275.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery2-1024x366.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery2-696x249.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery2-1068x382.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery2-1175x420.jpg 1175w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>On the right side, there is a section called “Gallery Settings.” Choose “Media File” in the “Link To” drop-down menu. Now the audience can click on any of your photos to display them full-screen. Under “Gallery Type,” select “tagDiv Slide Gallery.”</p>
<p>There are other settings here as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick how many columns you want for the gallery through the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>The photos get displayed in the order they were published or added to the Media Library. However, if you enable the “Random Order,” the pictures get arranged differently.</li>
<li>Type out a name for the element in the “Gallery Title.”</li>
<li>Resize the photos and how they appear for your audience through the Size drop-down menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you’re done, click the “Insert Gallery” button.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6104 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery3.jpg" alt="tagDiv Slide Gallery" width="1200" height="429" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery3.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery3-300x107.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery3-768x275.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery3-1024x366.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery3-696x249.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery3-1068x382.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery3-1175x420.jpg 1175w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Last Steps</h2>
<p>Use the Gutenberg interface to go back to editing the gallery. Just hover over it and then click the pencil icon. So, at any given point, you can add or remove any images.</p>
<p>All that’s left to do now is to “Publish” or “Update” your post. Great job!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6105 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery4.jpg" alt="tagDiv Slide Gallery" width="1200" height="587" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery4.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery4-300x147.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery4-768x376.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery4-1024x501.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery4-533x261.jpg 533w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery4-696x340.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery4-1068x522.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery4-859x420.jpg 859w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Now, when the users scroll through your post and come across the gallery, they can inspect it further by clicking on any photo. The picture then resizes to be full-screen, and they can use the arrows on the side of the picture to browse through the rest of your photos.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6106 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery5.jpg" alt="tagDiv Slide Gallery" width="1200" height="813" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery5.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery5-300x203.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery5-768x520.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery5-1024x694.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery5-696x472.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery5-1068x724.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/slidegallery5-620x420.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>

<p>Learn how to upgrade Newspaper Theme to the latest version easily. Choose which way to update: Automatically, via FTP (file transfer) or via WordPress. Everything is done quick and easy. Please follow through the tutorial below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Install-the-latest-updates-with-a-few-clicks.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2> A. Update the theme Automatically </h2>



<p>Our automatic update system make the entire update process so much simpler. In the Newspaper WordPress theme version 10.3.1, we have introduced the Automatic Theme Update feature. Now, every time a theme update is released, you’re at one click away from the new version. Starting with the Newspaper 10.3.2 version, you can automatically update your theme to the latest version available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a new update is found, you’ll get notified in the Update Notification System. When a Newspaper Theme update is available, you’ll see a red notification bullet in the Theme Panel &gt; Updates.  </p>



<p><em>Note: </em>If you have installed a new PRO demo on version 10.3.1 starting on March 29, 2020, it may not appear in the system that a new update is available for you to install automatically. In this situation, we recommend you to manually update the Newspaper Theme to version 10.3.2. If you need technical assistance to update your theme, please <a href="mailto:contact@tagdiv.com">send us an email</a> or open a new topic on the<a href="https://forum.tagdiv.com"> forum</a>, and our support team will help you.  </p>



<p> All you have to do is click on the Updates<strong> </strong>tab from the Newspaper Theme Panel and hit the “Install Update” button. The system downloads the latest version from the tagDiv servers and automatically updates the theme’ files and the native plugins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides the message that notifies you a new update is available, in&nbsp;<strong>Newspaper &gt;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Updates&nbsp;</strong>tab, you can also check out the theme versions’ availability. For example, if you’ve installed the latest theme version – 10.3.2 and you want to go back to 10.3.1, you can now select the theme version from the list dropdown and hit “Install version” button.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>B. Update the theme Manually</h2>



<h3><strong>Important Notes</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Always check our update notes</li><li>Always backup the files and the database, in case something goes wrong with the server. You could use the backup to revert to the previous state if you need to. For more information on how to backup check the&nbsp;<a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups">official documentation</a>.</li><li>Do not keep older copies of the theme inside WordPress themes folder</li><li>Reset the cache after you update</li><li>Update the plugins. The theme required and recommended plugins are included in the theme package inside the ../Newspaper-tf/plugins folder.

<p>There are 2 ways to update the theme manually. Each method has its own instructions, so let’s start with the first one!<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="370" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/file_manager.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11641" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/file_manager.png 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/file_manager-300x93.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/file_manager-1024x316.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/file_manager-768x237.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/file_manager-696x215.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/file_manager-1068x329.png 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h3>Update the theme via file transfer</h3>



<p>You first need to place your website in maintenance mode. Use a plugin to do this, for example, Ultimate Maintenance Mode, WP Maintenance Mode, and many others.</p>



<p>You can use any type of file manager at your disposal: your host cPanel, a FTP client or any file manager plugin. They all provide the same result. Copy, paste and delete files. That is all you need to do.  </p>



<ul><li>Access the file manager and open the &#8220;Themes&#8221; folder located in &#8220;Your Site’s Name/Wp-Content/Themes&#8221; and backup your Newspaper Theme folder by saving it somewhere on your computer or creating a zip archive of the theme (rename it to newspaper_backup.zip for example). Do not keep the archive with it&#8217;s original name and do not keep the theme as a folder with a separate name inside the themes section. This is not a good practice.  </li><li>After you make a back-up please&nbsp;<strong>delete</strong>&nbsp;the theme. </li><li>Download the newest version of the Newspaper Theme from ThemeForest.</li><li>Unzip the main &#8220;Newspaper-tf&#8221; archive if you chose to download the full theme package. You will find the main install-able zip file called Newspaper.zip inside of the Newspaper-tf.zip file. </li><li>Upload the &#8220;Newspaper.zip&#8221; file to your  &#8220;/Wp-Content/Themes&#8221; folder.</li><li>Now Extract the &#8220;Newspaper.zip&#8221; file.</li><li>Important: Update all of your plugins. For more information regarding this step&nbsp;please <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-install-plugins-and-update-plugins/" target="_blank">visit this link.</a></li></ul>



<h3>Update the theme via WordPress</h3>



<p> You first need to place your website in maintenance mode. Use a plugin to do this, for example, Ultimate Maintenance Mode, WP Maintenance Mode, and many others. </p>



<ul><li>Deactivate&nbsp;the current &#8220;Newspaper&#8221; theme from the Appearance &gt; Themes section by simply activating a different theme. Once you activate a different theme,&nbsp;delete&nbsp;the Newspaper theme. Don&#8217;t worry, your content will not be lost.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1202" height="629" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/delete_theme.png" alt="How to Update Newspaper Theme: Delete the old version" class="wp-image-11656" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/delete_theme.png 1202w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/delete_theme-300x157.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/delete_theme-1024x536.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/delete_theme-768x402.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/delete_theme-696x364.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/delete_theme-1068x559.png 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1202px) 100vw, 1202px" /></figure>



<ul><li>Get the “Newspaper.zip” file from your new Themeforest download (Install-able WordPress file only). If you downloaded the “All Files &amp; Documentation” from Themeforest, then you need to unzip the archive file you received, the Newspaper.zip will be inside it.</li><li>Go to Appearance &gt; Themes, choose&nbsp;Add New Theme, Upload the “Newspaper.zip” and click on the “Install Now” button.</li><li>After your upload is finished choose&nbsp;Activate&nbsp;the theme.</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forum.tagdiv.com/newspaper-how-to-update-a-plugin/" target="_blank">Update and activate the required plugins.</a></li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the Newspaper Theme, you can increase page loading speed on your WordPress website. To do this, first, you should test your website and take a look at google&#8217;s recommendations. In this article, we&#8217;ll guide to through the process. Please note that increasing page loading speed optimization may require more than basic server management knowledge.</p>
<h2>How to increase page loading speed?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Test your page speed <a href="http://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">here</a>. Just add your site URL and hit the analyze button. Please remove unnecessary plugins and don’t use Google Ads (Adsense) when testing (you can add them after that).</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5692 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pagespeed1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="472" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pagespeed1.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pagespeed1-300x118.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pagespeed1-768x302.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pagespeed1-1024x403.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pagespeed1-696x274.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pagespeed1-1068x420.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>2. Enable the Gzip compression<br />
3. Set the Leverage Browser Caching<br />
4. Optimize  your images<br />
5. Use a cache plugin (WP Super Cache)<br />
6. Plugin Load Optimization (optional &#8211; advanced)</p>
<p><strong> The list of speed recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We recommend that you use WP Super Cache with its default settings.</li>
<li>You can also use the APC full page cache if you have a lot of ram on your server</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you have a dedicated server / VPS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you have APC installed or another ‘op cache’ for PHP. This will reduce your server response time. We have received some reports that the accelerator has some problems in some specific configurations with our theme and Nginx.</li>
<li>Make sure that you have the compression enabled on your site for HTML/JS/CSS, but not for images.</li>
<li>Leverage browser caching <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/LeverageBrowserCaching" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/LeverageBrowserCaching</a> Google Page Speed requires that you set an expiring cache of 7 days or more</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use a shared hosting or a low power VPS, please update to a more powerful server for better speed results and performance.</p>
<p>You could also check the WordPress official optimization guide <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Optimization">here</a>.</p>
<p>Before you make any changes to your site, please backup the files where you intend to apply the modifications. Let&#8217;s modify the .htaccess file. Start by saving a copy of the file on your hard-drive. If something goes wrong, you can use it to return to the previous state. Now, let&#8217;s start!</p>
<h2>1. Enable Gzip compression</h2>
<p>This compresses the HTML and CSS and improves the page loading speed and reduces bandwidth usage.</p>
<p>The setup is different from one server to another, so you may have to look on your host instructions section to see how you can enable it on your site.</p>
<p>The theme demo server is set like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_deflate.c&gt;
&lt;filesMatch "\.(js|css|html|php)$"&gt;
SetOutputFilter DEFLATE
&lt;/filesMatch&gt;
&lt;/IfModule&gt;</code></pre>
<h2>2. Set the Leverage Browser Caching</h2>
<p>By setting this, you tell your visitors browsers to remember (caching) some of your website resources (that you don’t change so often, like the logo or the CSS/JS libraries, posted images, and many more) and only refresh them after a defined period.</p>
<p>To set it you have to add something like this on your .htaccess file.</p>
<p>NOTE: The setup may differ based on what resources you want to include.</p>
<p>Setup from the theme demo server:</p>
<pre><code># BEGIN Expire headers
&lt;ifModule mod_expires.c&gt;
ExpiresActive On
ExpiresDefault "access plus 5 seconds"
ExpiresByType image/x-icon "access plus 604800 seconds"
ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 604800 seconds"
ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 604800 seconds"
ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 604800 seconds"
ExpiresByType application/x-shockwave-flash "access plus 604800 seconds"
ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 604800 seconds"
ExpiresByType text/javascript "access plus 604800 seconds"
ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 604800 seconds"
ExpiresByType application/x-javascript "access plus 604800 seconds"
ExpiresByType application/x-font-woff "access plus 604800 seconds"
ExpiresByType application/x-font-svg "access plus 604800 seconds"
ExpiresByType image/svg+xml "access plus 604800 seconds"
&lt;/ifModule&gt;
# END Expire headers</code></pre>
<h2>3. Optimize images</h2>
<p>Images are one of the most abundant resources on your pages and the larger they are, the longer it will take to download, slowing the page loading speed.</p>
<p>To reduce their size and increase the page loading speed, you need to compress and optimize them. There are plenty of guides out there on how you can optimize the images (using software like Photoshop or similar).</p>
<p>Alternative:</p>
<p>Add the following code at the end of the functions.php, which is located in the theme folder. The code automatically compresses each thumbnail to 50%:</p>
<pre>add_filter( 'jpeg_quality', create_function('', 'return 50;' ) );</pre>
<p>After you add the code, you need to regenerate the thumbs. For this, you can use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/force-regenerate-thumbnails/">Force Regenerate</a> plugin.</p>
<p>The value 50 stands for 50% &#8211; if you want a better compression or better quality modify it and regenerate the thumbs. Experiment until you get the optimal value!</p>
<h2>4. Use a cache plugin (WP Super Cache)</h2>
<p>Find the plugin installation and configuration here &#8211; <a href="https://forum.tagdiv.com/cache-plugin-install-and-configure/">link</a></p>
<h2>5. Plugin Load Optimization (optional &#8211; advanced)</h2>
<p>Look for methods that allow you to control plugins, for Contact Form 7 check <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/optimizing-contact-form-7-for-better-performance--wp-31255">this one</a>.</p>

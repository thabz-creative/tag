										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>tagDiv themes have been developed with performance in mind, with every feature having a well-established purpose. Newspaper or Newsmag themes give you the possibility of building everything you were always trying to achieve with your website. The Newspaper and Newsmag WordPress themes come with <a href="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-install-plugins-and-update-plugins/">required plugins and optional ones</a> included, such as tagDiv Composer, tagDiv Cloud Library, tagDiv Social Counter, tagDiv AMP, Revolution Slider, and more. Besides the <a href="https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/213762463-Bundled-Plugins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plugins that come bundled</a> with the news themes (for which you do not have to pay extra money), there are some standalone plugins that are compatible with the tagDiv themes. In the WordPress &gt; Dashboard, you can see the list of the plugins compatible with the Newspaper Theme, respectively, with the Newsmag theme.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both themes are fully customizable and come with flexible, intuitive features. Sometimes this is not enough, and customers want to extend the themes’ functionality by installing different plugins regardless if they are tested or not with Newspaper or Newsmag. In this article, we’ll take a look into what exactly is the plugin compatibility, the ups and downs, as well as the recommended and tested plugins that work seamlessly with the Newspaper theme and Newsmag theme.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-what-plugin-compatibility-really-means">What Plugin Compatibility Really Means?</h2>



<p>Standalone plugins, similar to the themes, are developed and improved by their authors. Based on their activity and customer feedback, some of them are more often updated. Also, on the market, you could find free and premium plugins to install on your WordPress website. The free plugins that also have a premium version are more likely to be a reliable software addition to your website. “Ensuring plugin compatibility is essential to protect your site and help your plugins work together to bring the best user experience on your site. Compatibility is also important for any plugins you purchase and upload the file to your admin dashboard,” notes <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/tagdiv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluehost </a>in their <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/blog/how-to-check-if-your-plugins-are-compatible-with-your-site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to check the plugins’ compatibility with your website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-why-you-should-use-the-tested-plugins">Why You Should Use the Tested Plugins&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Every website owner wants his website to perform at its very best. But what happens when something goes wrong? When you’ve worked a lot to write great content, mix and match elements on the frontend to get the wanted results, and after you save the page, something isn’t right. You’ll say that the elements are rearranged and that the tagDiv Composer keeps loading, so you’ll assume that the theme is doing it, while this is all about a plugin conflict that was not tested with our theme. Do you think it’s a singular situation? Not really. This can happen every time you install a new untested plugin.</p>



<p>According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/" target="_blank">recent Kinsta WordPress statistic</a>s, there are over 55,000 plugins in the WordPress directory. Besides, there are the ones that are outside the WordPress repository and are available in free or premium versions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="660" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reading-which-plugin-is-compatible-with-which.jpg" alt="Compatibility between plugins" class="wp-image-14164" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reading-which-plugin-is-compatible-with-which.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reading-which-plugin-is-compatible-with-which-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reading-which-plugin-is-compatible-with-which-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reading-which-plugin-is-compatible-with-which-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reading-which-plugin-is-compatible-with-which-696x383.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reading-which-plugin-is-compatible-with-which-1068x587.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-can-untested-plugins-do-on-your-website">What Can Untested Plugins Do on Your Website? </h2>



<p>Plugins that are not tested with our WordPress themes can ruin your website and all the work you’ve invested in it. We’ve made a list of the most common sceneries you wouldn’t want to happen to you and your site. Untested plugins can:</p>



<ul><li>cause conflicts with the tagDiv Composer page builder and the tagDiv Cloud Library</li><li>crash your website and give multiple errors</li><li>grant site access for hackers, if plugins are not constantly updated</li><li>the support team behind a WordPress plugin cannot provide support if a theme has not been fully tested with the plugin. In this case, both us or the plugin’s support team cannot assist you with technical issues.</li><li>change how a feature works, but in a distinct way than other plugins.</li><li>might be developed to work with a different WordPress version.</li><li>be poorly-designed or badly coded.</li><li>overlap with plugins already installed on your site.</li></ul>



<p>In case you have untested plugins installed on your Newspaper or Newsmag websites and encounter an issue that is not related to our WordPress themes, we recommend you to use another environment to deactivate all your plugins and install the required plugins. Reactivate other plugins one by one and test your website on the frontend to see when the unusual situation appears.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-if-i-really-need-an-untested-plugin-what-should-i-do">What If I Really Need an Untested Plugin? What Should I Do?</h2>



<p>There are cases when you might need to use an untested plugin with tagDiv themes. You could send us an email, and we’ll add it to the list of plugins and test it with the Newspaper or Newsmag themes. This action will take a while, because we receive multiple requests, and choose the ones that are most popular. Meanwhile, you could create a staging WordPress website or a testing copy of the live website, and install the plugin to test it out. If the tested plugin works as expected with our themes, you can move it to the live website.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>We know that WordPress plugins give you extra functionality and that you may tend to use multiple ones, even if you do not necessarily need them. The multitude and variety of plugins can also ruin your site’s overall performance, security, reliability, and speed. Some good practices advise you never to exceed 20 plugins installed on your website and use a maximum of five if your website is on cloud or shared hosting. However, there are reputable websites using many more plugins that are all compatible with their database, resources, and HTTPS requests; and still maintain the website’s performance at high standards. This depends on how good you are with technical stuff.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Installing premium plugins in Newspaper Theme</h2>



<p>Installing a plugin is quick and easy with the click of a button. Access the Theme Panel -&gt; Plugins area and click on the install button. This button is dynamic as it will change its functionality based on your plugin status. It should change from &#8220;install&#8221; to &#8220;activate&#8221; to &#8220;update&#8221; depending on the scenario.</p>



<h2>Updating Plugins in Newspaper Theme</h2>



<p>In this section, we cover the necessary steps required for updating a plugin. We will show how&nbsp;to update a plugin in Newspaper theme&nbsp;using as an example the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">tagDiv Composer</a>. The Theme package includes the latest version for each plugin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="663" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/plugins-theme-pannnel.jpg" alt="Plugins in Newspaper Theme" class="wp-image-6614" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/plugins-theme-pannnel.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/plugins-theme-pannnel-300x166.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/plugins-theme-pannnel-768x424.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/plugins-theme-pannnel-1024x566.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/plugins-theme-pannnel-696x385.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/plugins-theme-pannnel-1068x590.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/plugins-theme-pannnel-760x420.jpg 760w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h3>Automatic Update</h3>



<p>The theme features an automatic update system for the tagDiv plugins. If an older version of the plugin is active, Newspaper automatically disables it, and you will be prompted to start the update.</p>



<p>The update process is simple and effective with just a push of a button.</p>



<p>Access the theme panel welcome screen and press the &#8220;Install/Activate&#8221; button:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="618" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/welcome_plugins.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11703" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/welcome_plugins.png 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/welcome_plugins-300x155.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/welcome_plugins-1024x527.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/welcome_plugins-768x396.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/welcome_plugins-696x358.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/welcome_plugins-1068x550.png 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h3>Manual Update</h3>



<p>We are highly recommending you to make a manual update only when you have the latest version of the theme package downloaded so that you can upload the newer version of the plugins. This is how you can do it:</p>



<p>1) From the WP-Admin &gt; Plugins section, deactivate and delete the plugin you want to update.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="274" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/deactivate-plugin.jpg" alt="install and update plugins" class="wp-image-4949" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/deactivate-plugin.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/deactivate-plugin-300x69.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/deactivate-plugin-768x175.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/deactivate-plugin-1024x234.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/deactivate-plugin-696x159.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/deactivate-plugin-1068x244.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p style="max-width:1200px">2) Go to WP-Admin &gt; Plugins &gt; Add New section<br>3) Press the &#8220;Upload Plugin&#8221; button<br>4) Press the &#8220;Choose File&#8221; button<br>5) Select the Newspaper-tf/plugins/td-composer.zip file from the latest theme package you downloaded from your Envato account and then press Open<br>6) Press the Install button</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><video autoplay loop src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Install-plugins.mp4" playsinline></video></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>7) Now you can activate the plugin, and your tagDiv Composer&nbsp;will be up-to-date.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image" style="max-width:1200px"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="264" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/installed-plugin.jpg" alt="install plugins" class="wp-image-4953" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/installed-plugin.jpg 800w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/installed-plugin-300x99.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/installed-plugin-768x253.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/installed-plugin-696x230.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<p>Following these steps, you can update&nbsp;each plugin with ease. Now that your theme and plugin are ready, start creating the website of your dreams. Have fun while building your website!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Newspaper theme comes with a free license for the Revolution Slider plugin, so you use it to create stunning imagery on your website. In this article, you have a step-by-step guide on using the Revolution Slider plugin with Newspaper Theme.</p>
<p>The license is a bundled one and does not come with an activation code. We provide regular updates for the plugin, so you do not need to purchase it to have access to its functionality, and features. Again, you don&#8217;t need to buy or registered this plugin!</p>
<h2>Using the Revolution Slider plugin with Newspaper Theme</h2>
<p>Our &#8220;Plugins panel&#8221; has to have all the plugins bundled into the main theme .zip file to be able to install them. We&#8217;re always trying to keep our theme&#8217;s file under 8 MegaBytes, the default upload limit on most hosting environments. Revolution Slider 5 has grown from 1.5MB to almost 5MB.</p>
<p>Due to licensing restrictions, we cannot download it from our servers to your host. So, the solution is to pack it in the plugins section of the Newspaper Theme in a bundle.</p>
<p>You can find Version 5 of the plugin under the following folder structure:</p>
<pre>Newspaper-tf\plugins\revolution_slider_5</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to install Revolution Slider 5</h2>
<p>Go to your WordPress admin panel and open the Plugins &gt; Add New section. Click on the Upload Plugin button and browse your local computer to find the Newspaper-tf  &gt; Plugins &gt; Revolution Slider 5 folder. Select the revslider.zip file and click the Install Now button.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5723 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revslider1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="607" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revslider1.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revslider1-300x152.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revslider1-768x388.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revslider1-1024x518.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revslider1-696x352.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revslider1-1068x540.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revslider1-830x420.jpg 830w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>After the process is over, activate the plugin.</p>
<h2>Importing sliders for theme demos</h2>
<p>The theme provides many predesigned sliders that are used together with the theme demos which you can import and use freely on your website.</p>
<p>Using the Revolution Slider plugin with Newspaper theme is a sure way to create visually impressive pages. Our designers used sliders in the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-installing-demos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demos</a>. This is the reason why, before using a predefined demo that contains a slider, you need to make a few adjustments:</p>
<p>1. After you have the demo installed, you must install the Revolution Slider plugin and activate it in the Plugins section.</p>
<p>2. Click the Import Slider button in the Revolution Slider section:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5724 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider2.jpg" alt="Revolution Slider plugin with Newspaper Theme: Getting Started" width="1200" height="614" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider2.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider2-300x154.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider2-768x393.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider2-1024x524.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider2-696x356.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider2-1068x546.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider2-821x420.jpg 821w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>3. Choose the slider associated with your theme demo (you can find it as a .zip file in Newspaper-tf\demo_sliders folder) and click the Import Slider button.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5725 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider3.jpg" alt="Revolution Slider plugin with Newspaper Theme: Importing Sliders" width="1200" height="653" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider3.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider3-300x163.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider3-768x418.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider3-1024x557.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider3-696x379.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider3-1068x581.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider3-772x420.jpg 772w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>4. Once you complete the installation, you can find it in the Revolution Slider section. You have to click the Settings symbol:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5727 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider4.jpg" alt="Revolution Slider plugin with Newspaper Theme: Settings for Sliders" width="1200" height="381" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider4.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider4-300x95.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider4-768x244.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider4-1024x325.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider4-696x221.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider4-1068x339.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>5. The slider requires a category to extract posts from, so you have to choose it from the list:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5728 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider5.jpg" alt="Revolution Slider plugin with Newspaper Theme: Importing slider for demos" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider5.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider5-300x158.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider5-768x403.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider5-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider5-696x365.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider5-1068x561.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/revolutionslider5-800x420.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>6. With the category set, all you have to do is save your changes by clicking the Save symbol on the right side of the page.</p>
<p>Now, you are ready to use the demo. You can also create a slider where you need it with ease. Have fun creating your website!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5057 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/install-newsletter.jpg" alt="tagDiv Newsletter plugin: Install plugin" width="1200" height="654" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/install-newsletter.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/install-newsletter-300x164.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/install-newsletter-768x419.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/install-newsletter-1024x558.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/install-newsletter-696x379.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/install-newsletter-1068x582.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/install-newsletter-771x420.jpg 771w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>How to use the tagDiv Newsletter plugin</h2>
<p>Once the plugin is installed and activated, you will find a new element in your tagDiv Composer element list:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5059 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newsletter-item.jpg" alt="tagDiv Newsletter plugin: tagDiv Composer Element list" width="300" height="635" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newsletter-item.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newsletter-item-142x300.jpg 142w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newsletter-item-198x420.jpg 198w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Drag and drop it into your page, and then you can customize it from the plugin settings.</p>
<p>You can set the title for your widget, a description in a few words, a disclaimer, an input test for your form, and the preferred alignment.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5060 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newsletter-provider.jpg" alt="tagDiv Newsletter plugin: Options panel" width="300" height="827" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newsletter-provider.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newsletter-provider-109x300.jpg 109w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newsletter-provider-152x420.jpg 152w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Afterward, you must choose the embed form provider. The Newsletter plugin requires an embed code from one of three sources: <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MailChimp</a>, <a href="https://www.mailerlite.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mailer Lite</a> or <a href="https://www.feedburner.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">FeedBurner</a>. You need to have an account created for your preferred newsletter form provider. Copy and insert the embedded form code into the newsletter options.</p>
<h2>MailChimp</h2>
<p>Create a new account or access your existing one, and navigate to Lists-&gt; Sign-up forms and then click &#8216;Embedded forms.&#8217;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5254 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailchimp.jpg" alt="tagDiv Newsletter plugin: MailChimp List" width="1200" height="678" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailchimp.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailchimp-300x170.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailchimp-768x434.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailchimp-1024x579.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailchimp-696x393.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailchimp-1068x603.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailchimp-743x420.jpg 743w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From here, copy the code and paste it in the Newsletter plugin &#8216;Embedded Form Code&#8217; section.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5255 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/embed-forms-mailchimp.jpg" alt="tagDiv Newsletter plugin: MailChimp script" width="1200" height="787" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/embed-forms-mailchimp.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/embed-forms-mailchimp-300x197.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/embed-forms-mailchimp-768x504.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/embed-forms-mailchimp-1024x672.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/embed-forms-mailchimp-696x456.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/embed-forms-mailchimp-741x486.jpg 741w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/embed-forms-mailchimp-1068x700.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/embed-forms-mailchimp-640x420.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Mailerlite</h2>
<p>Either create a new account or access your existing account and access the  &#8216;Forms&#8217; section. Once you create your form, you can get the code from the &#8216;Embed form&#8217; -&gt; HTML code section:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5256 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailerlite.jpg" alt="tagDiv Newsletter plugin: Mailerlite" width="1200" height="655" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailerlite.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailerlite-300x164.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailerlite-768x419.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailerlite-1024x559.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailerlite-696x380.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailerlite-1068x583.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mailerlite-769x420.jpg 769w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Feedburner</h2>
<p>Feedburner only needs an &#8216;ID&#8217; to work, not the whole embed code.</p>
<p>You can find the Feedburner ID by editing your account:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5257 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feedburner.jpg" alt="tagDiv Newsletter plugin: feedburner" width="1200" height="452" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feedburner.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feedburner-300x113.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feedburner-768x289.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feedburner-1024x386.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feedburner-696x262.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feedburner-1068x402.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/feedburner-1115x420.jpg 1115w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you set everything up, the newsletter form will be available on your page for users to sign up to.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5258 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newletter-form.jpg" alt="tagDiv Newsletter Plugin" width="1200" height="754" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newletter-form.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newletter-form-300x189.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newletter-form-768x483.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newletter-form-1024x643.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newletter-form-696x437.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newletter-form-1068x671.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/newletter-form-668x420.jpg 668w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>

<p>To increase the theme design flexibility, even more, we decided to add ten new Social Counter styles. Try them all and pick the one which works best for your project. You can choose a different design for the tagDiv Social Counter from the plugin settings panel:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Mobile Theme is a feature specially designed to maximize the theme performance on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Mobile devices are evolving at the speed of light, becoming smaller and faster each day. The key to the digital user experience is in your hands as visitors are searching for information and expect fast page loading speed &amp; fresh content. This is the ultimate challenge: making mobile experiences as fast and rewarding as the desktop ones. We took all these aspects back to the design board and solved them by creating the new Mobile Theme feature.</p>
<h2 class="td-new-separator">The philosophy</h2>
<p>The mobile browsing experience is often frustrating. The causes are multiple: slow page loading speed, a small text which is hard to read, low-quality images, banners&nbsp;blocking the content, buttons that are too close to each other making it impossible to tap on the desired one, and so on. We decided to put an end to this mess and, for this, we&nbsp;built the &#8220;Mobile theme.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="td-new-separator">How does it work?</h2>
<p>The Mobile Theme is a lighter, performance optimized template included in the Newspaper package and it loads ONLY on mobile devices. The Mobile theme comes with a template for pages, posts, categories, and more.</p>
<p>We have carefully tuned each template to offer optimal performance and excellent user experience. The posts come in a predefined, clean format including all the features available on the main theme. On the homepage, for example, it automatically renders a grid that contains featured posts and a latest posts section.</p>
<p>The theme doesn&#8217;t require any other plugin and ensures maximum performance.&nbsp;Once activated, a new administration panel becomes available in the Theme Panel area to allow you to customize various parameters for the &#8220;Mobile theme.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6739 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mobile-theme-with-amp.jpg" alt="Mobile Theme with Amp Support" width="1200" height="660" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mobile-theme-with-amp.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mobile-theme-with-amp-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mobile-theme-with-amp-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mobile-theme-with-amp-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mobile-theme-with-amp-696x383.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mobile-theme-with-amp-1068x587.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mobile-theme-with-amp-764x420.jpg 764w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p class="td-new-separator"><strong>Caching:</strong> The Mobile Theme works fine with WP Super Cache plugin. For more details on how to set the plugin visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.tagdiv.com/cache-plugin-install-and-configure/">Cache plugin – install and configure</a> page.</p>
<h2 class="td-new-separator">Installation:</h2>
<p>You can install and activate the plugin in the Theme Panel under the Plugins section</p>
<p><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mobile1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-4996 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mobile1.jpg" alt="tagdiv mobile theme" width="1200" height="667"></a></p>
<h2 class="td-new-separator">Page customization:</h2>
<p>For Homepage, the &#8220;Mobile Theme&#8221; comes with a single predefined page template that includes&nbsp;two sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>top grid &#8211; displays 3 featured posts (posts included in the Featured Category)</li>
<li>latest articles &#8211; shows the latest articles</li>
</ul>
<p>This template appears only if a Static Page is used. You can check out the page settings in the WordPress Admin panel Settings-&gt;Reading section.</p>
<h3>How to add images, custom HTML or text?</h3>
<p>You can bring these elements inside the&nbsp;Mobile Editor by editing the page.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-4996 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gutenberg-welcome-to-the-future.jpg" alt="tagdiv mobile theme" width="1200" height="639"></p>
<p>On the front-end, the custom elements appear between the&nbsp;Top Grid and the Latest Articles section.<br />
<img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-4996 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mobile-theme-welcome-to-the-future.jpg" alt="mobile theme" width="375" height="812"></p>
<div class="td-fs-red-box">
<h2>Important note:</h2>
<p>Regular pages &#8211; The content of custom pages (ex. Contact Us page), present on the desktop version of Newspaper theme, does not appear on the &#8220;Mobile theme.&#8221; The mobile version comes with an editor and gives you the possibility to add content that&#8217;s specially designed for mobiles. This offers you the opportunity to display the same content in two different ways, one optimized for desktops and another for mobiles.</p>
<p><a href="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-create-homepages-with-newspaper-theme/">Page builder elements</a> &#8211; For optimal performance, we removed the page builder dependency. You cannot use the page builder elements for the &#8220;Mobile theme&#8221; pages. If you want to display the same elements on both mobile and desktop, don’t use the mobile theme. Your website built on Newspaper theme will still look awesome on mobiles due to its responsive design. The Mobile Theme enhances the small screen user experience, but it is optional.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="td-new-separator">The Mobile Theme Settings:</h2>
<p>Once the plugin is installed a new tab called &#8220;Mobile Theme&#8221; shows up in the Newspaper -&gt; Theme Panel area.&nbsp;The options allow you to customize the look and functionality of the mobile theme.</p>
<p><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mobile6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-4996 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mobile6.jpg" alt="tagdiv mobile theme" width="1200" height="673"></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your website optimized for mobile? Discover how to make your pages AMP. Use the Official AMP plugin, tailored to integrate with all the features you love in the <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609">Newspaper theme</a>.</p>
<h2>How to install and activate the AMP plugin</h2>
<p>Firstly, you must access the Newspaper Plugins section, which contains all of the theme&#8217;s specific plugins. Then, press the Install button for both the <a href="https://amp-wp.org/documentation/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AMP</a> and <a href="https://tagdiv.com/mobile-theme-automatic-optimization-for-mobile-newspaper-theme/">Mobile Theme</a> plugin.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6675 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amp-activate.jpg" alt="AMP plugin - Activate" width="1200" height="550"></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve removed the previous AMP plugin as it was built on the initial launch implementation for AMP. The latest updates for the plugin opened up new possibilities for your website and we&#8217;ve made all of them available for you.</p>
<h2>Mobile Theme integration</h2>
<p>Now, AMP is integrated into the mobile theme plugin for faster results. You can benefit from all of the functionalities designed for small screens devices on your AMP pages. The mobile theme settings are AMP compatible, while the mobile theme transforms your AMP pages into beautiful layouts.</p>
<p>Choose one of the 3 Mobile Theme and AMP settings that best fit your project:</p>
<p><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mobile-theme-amp-settings.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone size-full wp-image-6895" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mobile-theme-amp-settings.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="742" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mobile-theme-amp-settings.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mobile-theme-amp-settings-300x186.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mobile-theme-amp-settings-768x475.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mobile-theme-amp-settings-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mobile-theme-amp-settings-356x220.jpg 356w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mobile-theme-amp-settings-696x430.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mobile-theme-amp-settings-1068x660.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mobile-theme-amp-settings-679x420.jpg 679w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mobile</b> &#8211; Displays content using the Mobile Theme on small screen devices (no AMP)</li>
<li><b>Mobile+Amp</b>&nbsp;&#8211; Displays content using the Mobile Theme on both mobiles and AMP</li>
<li><b>AMP</b> &#8211; Uses the responsive version of the theme on small screen devices and Mobile Theme only on AMP.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mobile Theme plugin is AMP native which means that all the Menus, Search button, Backgrounds, Colors, Excerpts, Ads, Custom code, now work with your AMP pages. You can find all the AMP plugin settings under the Mobile Theme settings from the Theme Panel.</p>
<p>Please read our official <a href="https://tagdiv.com/mobile-theme-automatic-optimization-for-mobile-newspaper-theme/">Mobile Theme Plugin Tutorial</a> to learn how to set all of the above.</p>
<h2>Speed is the key</h2>
<p>Speeding up Ads is a great way to <a href="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-set-up-cloudflare-cdn/">boost performance</a>. The Newspaper Theme brings you an intelligent ad system. It also works for AMP advertising, making your ads more visible. Newspaper Theme comes with six spots where you can place ads. See the Mobile Theme settings to configure them.</p>
<p>There is also implementation available for <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-auto-ads" rel="noopener">Adsense Auto Ads for AMP</a> now. You can now integrate such ads in the AMP ads section right from the Mobile Theme settings.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6675 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amp-ads.jpg" alt="AMP plugin - Mobile Theme settings" width="1200" height="716"></p>
<h2>Tracking is important</h2>
<p>With the AMP implementation, you can track your site traffic even on AMP content. All you have to do is access the Theme Panel &gt; Mobile Theme &gt; AMP Analytics, and paste your Google Analytics code. This section allows you to place the AMP Analytics&nbsp;code in the template header so you can track user interactions with AMP pages.</p>
<p>For the AMP Analytics Code to function correctly, please use the following implementation:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6675 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amp-analytics.jpg" alt="AMP plugin - Google Analytics tracking code" width="1200" height="715"></p>
<p>Using the SEO best practices and the recommendations of Yoast SEO plugin author, this solution is designed to work seamlessly with the&nbsp;<a href="https://demo.tagdiv.com/select_demo/select_demo_newspaper">Newspaper theme</a>. You can verify that everything&#8217;s working properly, using the browser emulator or the <a href="https://search.google.com/test/amp" rel="noopener">AMP testing tool.</a></p>
<p>In order to see a preview of your amp template, simply add &#8220;<em>/?amp</em>&#8221; at the end of the URL and the theme will render the AMP preview.</p>
<p>To avoid any AMP error, we recommend disabling the admin bar for AMP pages from the official plugin settings.</p>
<p><strong>Important note: </strong>the &#8220;supported templates&#8221; settings enable or disable AMP for specific templates. Make sure the template you want AMP to use on is active in this screen and make sure the Website mode is set to &#8220;Transitional&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amp_settings_2.png"><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone size-full wp-image-7848" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amp_settings_2.png" alt="" width="1200" height="715" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amp_settings_2.png 1648w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amp_settings_2-300x179.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amp_settings_2-768x457.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amp_settings_2-1024x610.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amp_settings_2-696x414.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amp_settings_2-1068x636.png 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amp_settings_2-706x420.png 706w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p>You can also enable or disable AMP for specific posts, pages, categories, etc from the WordPress editor so you have better control over specific localized activation</p>
<p><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/page-amp-activate.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone size-full wp-image-6897" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/page-amp-activate.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="628" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/page-amp-activate.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/page-amp-activate-300x157.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/page-amp-activate-768x402.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/page-amp-activate-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/page-amp-activate-696x364.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/page-amp-activate-1068x559.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/page-amp-activate-803x420.jpg 803w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p>The tools enhance the capabilities of your website to give you a new definition of performance.</p>
<p>Mobile pages should be light and fast! This way, they can keep the reader engaged and maintain return visits into favorable values. You can get a higher rank in Google search with the AMP pages and quality content. Thanks to the instant loading, the time spent on page increases, as well as the CTRs, and the bounce rates drop consistently.</p>

<p>With over 5 million active installations, WooCommerce is the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/">most popular eCommerce </a>plugin and has always been compatible with the Newspaper template. For example, some websites sell a few items and keep a blog to highlight their products and share news about them. Other websites are entire tech portals that sell gadgets. Starting with <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-11/">Newspaper version 11</a>, our news theme has become more WooCommerce friendly due to the new. We’ve added new, useful shortcodes and features for WooCommerce ready for you to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-what-are-woocommerce-shortcodes">What are WooCommerce shortcodes?</h3>



<p>WooCommerce shortcodes are pieces of code that you can easily insert into your posts or pages that bring eCommerce functionality. There are a few mandatory tools that must be always included in your site: shop, cart, related products, an easy-to-use filtering system, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="588" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page.jpg" alt="Create the Picture Perfect Layout for your Front Page Shop" class="wp-image-16833" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-300x147.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-1024x502.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-768x376.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-696x341.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-1068x523.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<p>Once you install WooCommerce on your site, you’ll notice that it comes with some pre-built shortcodes with the possibility to<a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/"> purchase more Woo extensions</a> and enlarge the plugin’s capabilities. However, starting with the Newspaper theme 11 update, we’ve added a new premium plugin called tagDiv Shop which is mandatory to run Shop Cloud Templates and extensive features compatible with the WooCommerce plugin. Furthermore, with the tagDiv Shop activated, you can install one of the Prebuilt eShop Websites our design team has carefully built. If you need help to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezaaE2VP7V8">install a prebuilt website design</a>, you can follow along with our video tutorial.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The homepage is the core of your website. It’s the starting point of the audience’s journey through your website, storage of vital links and data, a strategic asset for marketing goals. Most often, the homepage is the first visual and emotional touch that visitors have with your content and products. Fortunately, building homepages with Newspaper Theme is easy as a game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5114 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper.jpg" alt="Homepages with Newspaper Theme" width="1200" height="500" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-300x125.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-768x320.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-1024x427.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-696x290.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-1068x445.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-1008x420.jpg 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Homepages with Newspaper Theme</h2>
<p>If you’re creating your first website, remember to use clear structures for their homepages. Here are some important elements you can add to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headline &#8211; a short statement that reflects what the website’s all about</li>
<li>A hero element with simple imagery that should inspire your visitors to interact further</li>
<li>Call-to-action that draws the attention and uses active language</li>
<li>Present your blog content through Flex Grids and Blocks</li>
<li><a href="https://tagdiv.com/newsletter-plugin/">Newsletter subscription box</a> to attract more readers to follow and keep up-to-date with your content</li>
<li>Good navigation elements such as links in the menu to take the users easily across the website, a search function, and social network buttons</li>
<li>Testimonials to increase your credibility</li>
<li>A section with team members to help readers build an emotional connection with you</li>
</ul>
<p>These are popular elements for any Homepage. However, it should not be a limit to you, as you can always add more sections and items. Homepages with Newspaper Theme? The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p><video class="td-center td-article-img-border" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="1200" height="632"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source type="video/mp4" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Homepage.mp4"></video></p>
<h2>Homepage Templates</h2>
<p>Your goals are essential when you start out. Do you want to dabble in e-commerce? Are you going to use the site as a blog? Or, maybe, showcase your portfolio of works and creative products. You should know the answer before starting the process and design the website to best serve that purpose.</p>
<p>Newspaper Theme offers a variety of Homepage designs to choose from to begin easily. From the WordPress Admin Dashboard, open the Cloud Templates section and click on the “Add New” button. You will be greeted with a digital library of our designers’ creations, with over a thousand templates; from Article, Author, and <a href="https://tagdiv.com/find-whats-new-category-templates/">Category Page Templates</a> to <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introducing-new-404-page-templates/">404 Page Error ones</a>, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Choose the Homepage tab and scroll down to see each design. Click on the one that catches your eye to see a live preview of it, or import it directly to your website. After the import is over, &nbsp;make it a part of your vision! Edit and customize each element to your heart’s desire and create something brand new.</p>
<h2>Make your Custom Homepage</h2>
<p>In your Admin Dashboard, navigate to the Pages section and click on the “Add New” button. Give the page a title such as Index or Homepage. Save the page. Press the “tagDiv Composer” button to access the front-end editing section.</p>
<p>Let’s make an efficient yet beautiful Homepage. Add a Hero Element by dragging and dropping it onto the blank page. The item has a default appearance and settings, so click on it to open the settings and customize it to perfection! Write a short description of your site’s purpose and draw the readers in through a short Title.</p>
<p><video class="td-center td-article-img-border" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="1200" height="686"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source type="video/mp4" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Create-your-own-homepage-with-Newspaper-Theme.mp4"></video></p>
<p>For content-heavy websites, the general advice is to add a Flex Grid and Flex Block to display all of your relevant posts and articles. However, the decision is in your hands.</p>
<p>If you want to interact with your audience further, add a Row with the Team Member Element. This gives you the possibility to showcase everyone contributing to your website, from authors to designers. Include a description for each member to allow the visitors to build an emotional connection with you.</p>
<h2>Creation, design, perfection</h2>
<p>Keep the layout nice and simple. Here’s a tip: create gaps between sections using white space to help your visitors navigate through the page easily. Add relevant information on the homepage such as a small showcase of your products, testimonials from clients, ads to monetize your site, buttons that invite your readers to engage further. The sky is the limit on what you can create!</p>
<p>Each element that you add on the page with the tagDiv Composer can be clicked on to customize even further. Choose font families in accordance with your vision. Color palettes are great to maintain through each page and the entire website.</p>
<p>For example, for a non-profit organization whose goal is to stop deforestation, their site’s color palette could be browns and greens to inspire the idea of trees and nature. Think of a travel beach resort website. They might use blues and yellows to represent the sun and the blue summer sky and help you immerse yourself in the dream vacation they want to portray. So, pick them to serve your goal.</p>

<p>The tagDiv Cloud Library brings you over 1200+ already-built layouts. We have designed it to simplify the way you create layouts in the Newspaper theme and make your website stand out! The innovative system of tagDiv Cloud Library allows you to import templates and customize them using the drag and drop functionality.</p>



<p>The plugin has three significant purposes:</p>



<ul><li>Helps you <strong>create stunning templates and pages</strong> quickly, without the hassle of adding CSS code;</li><li>Allows you to <strong>use of the tagDiv Composer</strong> on all WordPress templates;</li><li>Provides a <strong>growing database of pre-made templates</strong>, homepage, sections, blocks and so forth.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube alignwide wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Newspaper WordPress Theme Tutorial: How to Import and Assign Cloud Library Templates" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6m8-EebnfM0?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>With the tagDiv Cloud Library, there’s no need to create your content from scratch. You can easily import the selected element, and use it directly or customize it to your preference and style. You can also import pages easily with one click! Just add your content straight through the tagDiv Composer, and you have a beautiful page from scratch. Find out more about the tagDiv<a href="https://tagdiv.com/cloud-library-page-templates-newspaper-theme/"> Cloud Library Page Templates here</a>.</p>



<p>Think of it as a template builder that comes with a vast collection of layouts for every section of your site. You can browse the tagDiv Cloud Library collection, preview the unique designs, and import the one(s) you love!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="687" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library.jpg" alt="activate tagdiv cloud library" class="wp-image-13658" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-300x172.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-768x440.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-696x398.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-1068x611.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-tagdiv-cloud-library">How to use tagDiv Cloud Library</h2>



<p>First, make sure to activate the plugin from the theme plugins section:</p>



<p>Then go to either a category, author, tag, date, or post on your website. As long as you’re logged in, the WordPress admin bar contains a green button: Cloud Library. Click it to open the tagDiv Cloud Library and browse through the selection of predesigned templates. If you want to create your own, choose the “Blank Template” one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Click on any of them to open their “Create Template” window. Hit the button to have it imported and assigned straight onto the page you’re currently on. Great! But how do you set it globally? What if you want the current template to be on all your categories or posts? To the left of the “Cloud Library” button on your WordPress admin bar, you have your template button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you click on this tab, it opens a dropdown window with every template suitable for the page you&#8217;re editing. It should look something like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="422" height="276" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a-template-list.png" alt="a template list" class="wp-image-13654" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a-template-list.png 422w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a-template-list-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /></figure>



<p>Any Template that you click on is applied on the current page. Please note that it does not get set globally. To assign it globally, you need to check the box next to the wanted template. Then, every page of the same type will use the template assigned by you globally.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1197px"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-to-Import-a-Cloud-Library-Template.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2 id="h-duplicate-rename-delete-templates">Duplicate, Rename, Delete Templates</h2>



<p>From the same dialogue box previously opened, you can delete, rename, and duplicate templates. When hovering over the title of a template, three dots appear to the right of it. Move your cursor top of the dots to get access to the following icons<img loading="lazy" width="57" height="19" class="wp-image-13641" style="width: 57px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/icons-for-templates.png" alt="icons for templates">.</p>



<p>Let’s explore each one starting from the left, moving to the right:</p>



<ul><li>The trash can icon deletes the template hovered upon. Any deleted templates can be found in the trash of your WordPress Admin Dashboard &gt; Cloud Templates &gt; Trash.</li><li>To the right of the trash icon, you have the duplicate icon. It makes a copy of the template.</li><li>When you click on the pencil icon, you can rename the template. This is perfect for organizing all templates.</li></ul>



<p>Now that the Template button has been fully explored, let’s move on to editing and creating a new template from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Delete-rename-and-duplicate-Templates-with-the-new-template-button.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2 id="h-create-templates-from-scratch">Create Templates from Scratch</h2>



<p>Before we jump into the creation process, check out the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">tagDiv Composer basics tutorial </a>to familiarize yourself with the workflow of dragging-and-dropping items to create your page’s layout. When you travel to a category, post, tag, date, search, or author page, next to the “Cloud Library” button on your WordPress Admin Bar, there is an “Edit Template” button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is only available if you have installed a demo, or imported a template already. When you click it, you get to drag and drop elements that are necessary for your audience. Keep in mind the user experience &#8211; you want every functionality to be highly visible and easily accessible. Take a look at our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/a-guide-to-avoid-web-design-mistakes/">guide to avoid design mistakes</a> and learn what the do’s and don’t’s of web design are.</p>



<p>Keep everything cohesive, restrict the number of fonts you use on the template to a maximum of three. If you need inspiration, you can also take a look at our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/seven-design-trends-for-2020/">2020 Design Trends,</a> which encompasses the year’s most popular styles. Once you’re done creating the elements, stylizing them, and choosing colors, save your settings by clicking the save icon on your tagDiv Composer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="43" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tagdiv-composer-bar.png" alt="tagdiv composer bar" class="wp-image-13642"/></figure>



<h2 id="h-let-s-sum-it-up">Let’s sum it up</h2>



<p>By exploring different templates and finding out what works best for your website, you get experience. Newspaper Theme opens up a whole new world of creation and possibilities as each choice can impact your audience. Design something stunning that makes use of excellent user experience to connect better with your viewers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The success of a website depends on various aspects, such as the overall usability, visual design, and brand consistency. These impact the opinion users have of your site. Can they quickly find their way around? Help them navigate by having a clean and engaging footer with Newspaper Theme. Designing a beautiful one is easy to do with our frontend page builder, the tagDiv Composer. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="320" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme.jpg" alt="Footer with Newspaper Theme Newsletter" class="wp-image-6086" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-300x80.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-768x205.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-1024x273.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-696x186.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-1068x285.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>How to create a Footer with Newspaper Theme</h2>



<p>Open the tagDiv Composer frontend builder on any of your pages or Cloud Library Templates. Click on the Manager button on the top bar of your Composer. As an alternative, you can click the button in the middle of your Composer that says “Website Manager.” Whichever option you choose, a window should show up containing not only the Footer settings but also the Header ones. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="466" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/import-footer-templates.jpg" alt="Import Footer Templates by clicking on the &quot;Import Footer&quot; button" class="wp-image-10882" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/import-footer-templates.jpg 400w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/import-footer-templates-258x300.jpg 258w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></figure></div>



<p>Under the “Choose Footer Template,” click on the “Import Footer” button. This brings up the Cloud Library from which you can import a pre-designed Footer template, or make your own. Pick the one you want and then hit <strong>“Import.”</strong> You now have your own footer that you can customize on the front end. Change the links, choose a fitting description, upload your Logo Image, and customize the colors to fit your website’s color palette. You’re done! Hit “Save” and your new footer should be applied on the page or template you created it on. </p>



<p>To set the footer globally, go to your WordPress Admin Dashboard &gt; Newspaper’s Theme Panel &gt; Footer. Now, from the first section, choose the imported footer that you’ve just finished customizing and save.</p>



<h2>A blank new Footer to fit your vision</h2>



<p>Just like you previously imported a pre-designed template, you can import a blank one. Open the tagDiv Composer and hit the “Website Manager” button. From the new window, press the “Import Footer” button, which opens the tagDiv Cloud Library. Now choose the “Blank Footer Template,” and you can begin editing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border td-caption-align-https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer.jpg" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="426" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer.jpg" alt="Import a beautiful footer from the tagDiv Cloud Library" class="wp-image-10660" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer-300x107.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer-1024x364.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer-768x273.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer-696x247.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer-1068x379.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>Split the row into columns if you want. Now, start by bringing items to the footer zone. Don’t clutter it with too many elements. Organize each one with purpose and group them to create structure and a neat layout. After all, the first rule for editing and designing is “simple is better.”</p>



<p>Here are a few elements you could add to the footer straight from the tagDiv Composer:</p>



<ul><li>A List Menu.</li><li>Column Title</li><li>Social Icons</li><li>Inline Text / Column Text</li><li>Instagram</li><li>Header Logo</li><li>Newsletter</li><li>Call-to-Action / Button</li></ul>



<p>Get creative with each element to make it fit perfectly into your website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube alignwide wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="How to Import the New Footer Templates with Newspaper WordPress Theme" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nE51MfLV7hE?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2>Let’s get more specific</h2>



<p>Each link you add to the footer can be adjusted to match the layout of your site. With the List Menu element, create a ‘Footer Menu’ straight from the WordPress Dashboard &gt; Appearance &gt; Menus. Add links to the Contact, and Privacy Policy pages as these are essential for your footer navigation.</p>



<p>Using the Inline Text or Column Text element, write the email address, phone number, and the physical address of your company so that visitors can reach out to you conveniently. Include links to your social media through the Social Icons element. Adjust the icons’ size so they can still be visible. After all, footer items tend to be smaller than their content – counterpart.</p>



<p>A copyright notice is a lifesaver for everyone. It can be included by adding the Inline Text element and can include the circular “c” symbol. The year of publication and name of the copyright owner should also be mentioned.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border td-caption-align-https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink.jpg" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="382" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink.jpg" alt="Footer with Newspaper Theme IamThiLink" class="wp-image-6083" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink-300x96.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink-768x244.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink-1024x326.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink-696x222.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink-1068x340.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Encourage Interaction in the Footer with Newspaper Theme</h2>



<p>Once visitors reach the footer, give them something to do while they’re there. Include a Subscription box if you intend to deliver updates by email, or use the Call-to-Action element to invite them to a different page and continue scrolling through the content.</p>



<p>Remember: fonts in the footer have to be smaller than the ones used by the page’s body. Think about the color you use for the background and text, create contrast so that each line is noticeable. For more information on choosing appropriate fonts, check out our<a href="https://tagdiv.com/typography-guide-101-basics-tips-ideas-inspiration/"> typography blog post here</a>.</p>



<p>Spacing is essential for the layout of your footer. Leave plenty of room for each section so that lines aren’t too cramped or uninviting. Think in terms of hierarchy: what do you want the visitors to notice first? Your company’s logo or the subscription box? Make the most important element stand out from the rest. You can do that by changing size on the element, adding padding and margins to the column, row, or individual items in your footer.</p>



<p>When you’re done, hit Save. If you want to assign the footer globally, go to your WordPress Admin Dashboard &gt; Newspaper Theme Panel &gt; Footer. Now choose your new template from the dropdown menu list in the first panel.</p>

<h2>Make multiple footers for different pages / templates</h2>



<p>Whether you need a different layout, or you want to entice the reader with a different offer, you might need to create a new footer. But how does this work with the new template system? It’s simple! Just as you would create <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-customize-the-header-manager/">multiple headers</a> with the Website Manager, you do the same with footers.</p>



<p>Open the page or template you want to assign a different footer other than your global one. From the tagDiv Composer, click on “Website Manager” and in the footer section, choose the one you want to assign from the dropdown menu. Now hit Save, and you’re done! Your page or template now has a different footer.</p>



<p>You can do this multiple times. With Newspaper Theme, you can have a myriad of footers at your disposal. However, it is best to consider that if you have multiple different footers with clearly unique styles, it may distract your reader.</p>



<p>Instead, you could use a different footer on landing pages that are meant to keep a different aspect compared to the rest of your website already. This is a brilliant idea as it allows you to include different links entirely for just this one page.</p>



<h2>No Footer? No problem!</h2>



<p>Do you have a page that is cluttered with millions of different elements? If you want the reader only to pay attention to the content of the page, getting rid of the footer entirely might help your cause. How would you do that? Just open the tagDiv Composer on the page or template in question.</p>

<p>Press the “Manager” button at the top of the tagDiv Composer to open the Website Manager. From the footer section, choose the “No Footer” option in the dropdown menu. That’s it! That’s all you have to do. Don’t forget to Save it!</p>



<p>This fantastic new option comes in handy when you need to keep the audience on a specific page or template.</p>



<h2>Last but not least&#8230;</h2>



<p>Newspaper Theme helps you get a clean design for the footer. However, give the audience what they want in terms of usability: links. Keep the Contact Page and Privacy Policy at the top as they are essential for any footer. The Copyright notice should be on a separate row, usually underneath the other elements as a mention to the rightful owner of the website and the publication date. Invite your audience to interact further with you through Social Network links, a subscription box, or a Call-to-Action. Lastly, resize and group items while keeping the layout spacious and neat.</p>



<p>Have you designed a footer with<a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"> Newspaper Theme</a> yet? Show us your wonderful results in the comment box below!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For artistic websites that have a ton of beautiful images on various pages, a minimalistic Header is the perfect support for your content. Newspaper Theme&#8217;s Header Builder can help you strike a great balance between bold visuals and minimal fonts with an Overlay Header. What’s more, fashion, beauty, creative magazines can employ this type of look for a multitude of pages.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6675 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like.jpg" alt="what an Overlay Header looks like" width="1200" height="550" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like-300x138.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like-768x352.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like-1024x469.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like-696x319.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like-1068x490.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like-916x420.jpg 916w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Welcome the Overlay Header</h2>
<p>Do you have a page or template with a beautiful color added to the background or an image that stretches across the screen? A Single Post Template that has a Background Featured Image, a page with a wide <a href="https://tagdiv.com/try-new-flexible-big-grids-with-newspaper-theme/">Flexible Big Grid</a> or <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-flex-block-elements/">Block</a>, and even one with a Hero element on it can be the perfect start.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Don’t use an Overlay Header on a blank page or template as your content gets pushed underneath each element contained within your header: the Live Search, Logo, and even Navigational Menu.</p>
<p>If you’re new to creating a Header then read <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-customize-the-header-manager/">this blog post</a> first to find out how to use the Header Builder.</p>
<p>Ready to start? Then open the tagDiv Composer and go to the Header Menu Zone settings. At the bottom, from the “Display” drop-down menu, choose the “Overlay” option. As long as you don’t have a set background to your header, it becomes transparent. Does it look exactly as you imagined it, too? Make any further adjustments to the text colors and fonts and you’re done! This Header gets applied to the page you opened up as soon as you hit save.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6774 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid.jpg" alt="Overlay Header with a Flex Grid" width="1200" height="588" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-300x147.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-768x376.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-1024x502.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-324x160.jpg 324w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-533x261.jpg 533w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-696x341.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-1068x523.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-857x420.jpg 857w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Layout and Style of an Overlay Header</h2>
<p>For a great user experience, especially when you apply an Overlay Header on a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/customize-articles-with-single-post-templates/">Single Post Template</a>, add an overlay gradient on top of the image that is under the header. This way, when your visitors navigate to a different article with another featured image so that the menu’s text can be easily read.</p>
<p>You can get a clean look for the page by using a sans-serif font in the header. After you’ve chosen the font, you can move on to your Mobile Header. Add the Logo, Mobile Menu, and Mobile Live Search elements to the header. For more information, check out this <a href="https://tagdiv.com/mobile-header-newspaper-theme/">blog post here</a>.</p>
<p>Hit Save and you can easily import the header on other pages of your website. However, we advise you not to set it as your site-wide template. An <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-cloud-library-archive-templates/">archive page</a> or even a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introducing-new-404-page-templates/">404 Template</a> will have the text overlapping the menu. For stunning results, make it unique and use it sparingly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6682 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-on-a-Single-Post-Template.jpg" alt="Overlay Header on a Single Post Template" width="1200" height="668" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-on-a-Single-Post-Template.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-on-a-Single-Post-Template-300x167.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-on-a-Single-Post-Template-768x428.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-on-a-Single-Post-Template-1024x570.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-on-a-Single-Post-Template-696x387.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-on-a-Single-Post-Template-1068x595.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-on-a-Single-Post-Template-754x420.jpg 754w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>

<h2 id="h-cloud-library-page-template">Cloud Library Page Template</h2>



<p>Hierarchy is important when someone builds a page from scratch. You need to show what’s important first. Scale the other elements down to attract the user’s view to the titles and featured articles, slowly guiding him to the bottom. Each time you create a new page, you try to create symmetry.</p>



<p>The spacing between elements has to follow a pattern that creates harmony. A well-balanced layout is like the structure of a house. To save you time and a lot of effort our design team has worked on building creative and diverse page templates that you can import straight to the website. Each one becomes a new page that is entirely editable and customizable to fit your needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the increase in mobile browsing and shopping, optimization for portable devices is essential for a successful website. Therefore, having a slick and elegant design for your mobile header is the first step toward impressing your audience. Take the plunge and find out how to make a fantastic Mobile Header with Newspaper Theme below.</p>
<h2>The Introduction of Mobile Header Elements</h2>
<p>Open a page or post through the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">tagDiv Composer</a>, Newspaper Theme’s front-end page builder. Have you imported a Header template from the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/what-is-the-cloud-library/">Cloud Library</a>, yet? If you haven’t, then do so by clicking on the Website Manager and then on the Import Template button under the &#8220;Header&#8221; section. Scroll through the various designs and choose the one that fits your website best.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center alignnone wp-image-5810 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Menu-.jpg" alt="Mobile Header Menu" width="1200" height="628" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Menu-.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Menu--300x157.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Menu--768x402.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Menu--1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Menu--696x364.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Menu--1068x559.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Menu--803x420.jpg 803w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Now, click on any element of your Header or content and then click on the Mobile Device Viewport icon. The entire page now gets displayed as it would look like on the phone. Did you notice how the Header shrank in size alongside the content? That’s the power of the new Mobile Header elements.</p>
<p>Before we move on how to get the same result for your website from scratch, make sure to check out the other related articles for the Header Manager: <a href="https://tagdiv.com/create-a-logo-with-newspaper-theme/">the Header Logo</a>, <a href="https://tagdiv.com/header-main-menu-newspaper-theme/">Main Menu</a>, <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-header-live-search-feature/">Live Search</a> and last but not least the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-customize-the-header-manager/">Header Manager</a>. Do this to get a good grasp on how to use the new features!</p>
<h2>Build your Mobile Header Easily</h2>
<p>When looking at your page across various devices, the design automatically gets adjusted to fit on various screens and sizes. However, you can always adjust the text size and spacing of each element precisely as you wish by clicking on the desired screen viewport and consequently, beginning the alterations.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5811 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Fashion.jpg" alt="Mobile Header Fashion" width="1200" height="659" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Fashion.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Fashion-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Fashion-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Fashion-1024x562.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Fashion-696x382.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Fashion-1068x587.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Fashion-765x420.jpg 765w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>On the Mobile, however, your job gets easier. With the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/whats-new-in-newspaper-theme-9-5-update/">Newspaper Theme 9.5</a>, alongside the various elements of the Header, new mobile-centered items are available to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mobile Menu will display a small icon. When clicked on, it opens a list of the menu items so that you can have an elegant layout for the header.</li>
<li>Just like the desktop version, there is a Mobile Live Search element that you can add to your Header. It is specifically modified to bring the same performance on smaller screens as its desktop version.</li>
<li>Do you want to keep the same look across each device through the menu? With the Mobile Horizontal Menu, you can now do so. Each item is shrunk to appear better on the phone screen and lets you display all of the essential navigational links at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, start by dragging and dropping the Header Logo and then adding the Mobile Menu and Mobile Live Search. With the three items added, you can now begin going through the settings for each.</p>
<h2>Slick Designs for Better Functionality</h2>
<p>By default, the Mobile Menu and Mobile Live Search open with the theme’s default fonts and colors. However, you can easily modify this in the Newspaper Theme Panel. In the Admin Dashboard, navigate to the Newspaper Theme Panel. From there, go to Theme Colors &gt; Mobile Menu/Live Search for colors.</p>
<p>If you need to modify the fonts, go to Theme Fonts &gt; Mobile Menu. Also, if you wish to display a specific image as background, open the Background section, then select Mobile Menu/ Search Background tab. Simply upload a photo in the box and save your settings. These will be instantly applied to the new mobile elements.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5812 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Beach.jpg" alt="Mobile Header Beach" width="1200" height="724" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Beach.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Beach-300x181.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Beach-768x463.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Beach-1024x618.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Beach-696x420.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mobile-Header-Beach-1068x644.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Now, back to the tagDiv Composer, don’t forget to select a Menu to be displayed for your Mobile Menu from the General Settings of the element. For a sticky mobile Header, drag the items into the row once more, or through <a href="https://tagdiv.com/right-click-menu-tagdiv-composer/">the right-click menu</a>, right-click on the Header row and <a href="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-use-the-new-copy-paste-tools-for-elements/">choose Copy</a>. In the empty Header row for your Sticky Menu, right-click and select Paste Before or Paste After, then delete the remaining empty row.</p>
<p>Your design has now been transferred to the sticky mobile variant. Adjust the spacing and sizes of the icons and logo to get a beautiful thin header. Add a transition to the Mobile Menu Sticky zone and a background to the row to be able to see it displayed over your content. Save, and you’re done!</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Get in touch with your creative side and design a minimalistic mobile header to impress the audience. Adjusting the logo’s size and choosing between two different ways to display your menu it’s easy. You should create a beautiful user experience for the visitors that are scrolling through your website by making the header smooth to navigate.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Create the perfect navigation bar for your website. Want to keep it simple, create lists of items or bedazzle the audience with a Mega Menu to die for? Newspaper Theme is here to help you out and make everything easier.</p>
<h2>Header Main Menu &#8216;How to&#8217; &amp; &#8216;What ifs&#8217;</h2>
<p>Open the tagDiv Composer on any page of your website. It can be blank or already constructed and designed. Click the new Website Manager button. If you’ve already created a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/create-a-logo-with-newspaper-theme/">Header Logo</a> &amp; <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-header-live-search-feature/">Live Search</a>, then the functions of the Website Manager should be nothing new to you. However, to find out more about the<a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-customize-the-header-manager/"> big new feature head</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5770 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-Mega-Menu-with-Subcat.jpg" alt="Header Main Menu Mega Menu with Subcat" width="1200" height="679" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-Mega-Menu-with-Subcat.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-Mega-Menu-with-Subcat-300x170.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-Mega-Menu-with-Subcat-768x435.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-Mega-Menu-with-Subcat-1024x579.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-Mega-Menu-with-Subcat-696x394.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-Mega-Menu-with-Subcat-1068x604.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-Mega-Menu-with-Subcat-742x420.jpg 742w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Are you ready to meet the new <a href="https://tagdiv.com/whats-new-in-newspaper-theme-9-5-update/">Newspaper Theme 9.5</a> header builder? Import an already crafted Header Template from the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/what-is-the-cloud-library/">Cloud Library</a>. Now, take a look at the beautiful Menu widget. Click it, and inspect its settings further to get accustomed to it.</p>
<p>In the General Settings tab, right at the top, select your Menu. However, first, make sure you already have a Menu created precisely for the page you’re editing. Let’s get started!</p>
<h2>Header Main Menu Widget</h2>
<p>In the WordPress Admin Dashboard, hover over Appearance and click the Menus page. Now, on the left, you have all of your Pages, Categories, and Posts, while on the right, you can see your current Menu Structure.</p>
<p>Click on Create a new Menu at the top. Give it a name and then press the Create Menu button. Now, choose which item you want for your menu. Keep in mind the Header Menu should contain only the essential navigational elements. So, don’t clutter it. You can start by adding the Homepage link, then Categories, important Pages and finish with the Contact page.</p>
<h2>List Menu, Mega Menu, Mega Menu with Sub-Categories</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-5861" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-main-menu-WP.jpg" alt="Header Main Menu" width="320" height="215" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-main-menu-WP.jpg 447w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-main-menu-WP-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" />If you need to display more items in the navigation bar, you can easily create a Sub-Menu. Let me show you how to do that! Add a general item, such as Categories. Now, drag and drop the other elements underneath it to create submenu items. This way they become linked to the general item (in our case Categories).</p>
<p>For Mega Menu with subcategories, you need to have a parent Category with multiple other child categories. You can do this easily by going to Posts, then Categories. Hover over any Category then click Edit. From the Parent Category drop-down menu, choose its parent. Now, save your changes.</p>
<p>Go back to Appearance &gt; Menus. Add the parent category to your new menu and then click the small arrow to the right to open its tab. Under the ‘Make this a Category Mega Menu,’ choose the Parent Category again.</p>
<p><video class="td-center td-article-img-border" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="1200" height="680"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source type="video/mp4" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-Video.mp4"></video></p>
<p>To create a Mega Menu element without subcategories list, you can follow the same steps. Add the Category to the menu, then open its tab using the small arrow and choose the same item in the ‘Make this a Category Mega Menu.’ Great! Save your menu.</p>
<h2>Customize &amp; Design the Header Main Menu</h2>
<p>Why don’t we build a menu from scratch? Open the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">tagDiv Composer</a> on your page, import a Blank Header Template from the Cloud Library. Then drag the Header Main Menu element to your Header section.</p>
<p>In the General Settings, select the Menu you’ve just created. The next 3 options are referring to MegaMenu with SubCategories item, Mega Menu item or SubMenu. They can be enabled one by one to see how each one looks. However, do not enable all 3 options together, because they stack on top of each other. Enable them one by one as you design and edit them.</p>
<p>Scroll down to access the Main Menu and Sub-Menu sections. Each one brings you options that allow you to customize the Links from the Menu.</p>
<h2>Mega Menu Customization Details</h2>
<p>Open the Mega Menu tab and look through its settings. The ‘Container Width’ affects the size of your Mega Menu. To get the desired layout, you can also modify the next few options.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5771 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-SubMenu.jpg" alt="Header Main Menu SubMenu" width="1200" height="487" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-SubMenu.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-SubMenu-300x122.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-SubMenu-768x312.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-SubMenu-1024x416.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-SubMenu-696x282.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-SubMenu-1068x433.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Main-Menu-SubMenu-1035x420.jpg 1035w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>The Subcategories section refers to Items in your menu that are Parent Categories and have been enabled as Mega Menu elements. Change the padding of the list, the width, the elements’ space, and many more to get the best results. You should do this with the ‘Show mm. with subcats’ in the tagDiv Composer enabled, so that you can see the adjustments happening live.</p>
<p>In the ‘Mega Menu Module’, you can change how Posts and Articles appear within the box. There are options for Article Featured Images and the Meta Info, too.</p>
<p>From Article Title, Excerpt, Category tag, Author name and Photo, choose what looks best with the rest of your Header and website. Hide or Show different elements and modify their size and alignment.</p>
<h2>Styling your Header Main Menu</h2>
<p>Click on the Style tab to choose colors and fonts for each part of your navigation bar. Start with the Main Menu section, select the text color and hover animation for it. Decide what fonts work best with the rest of your website and website’s core intention. Check out more about <a href="https://tagdiv.com/typography-guide-101-basics-tips-ideas-inspiration/">picking the best fonts</a>.</p>
<p>Up next is the Sub-Menu. You can style the menu elements by deciding on a hover animation, colors, and fonts for them. All of these changes affect the List menu items you’ve added in the WordPress ‘Menus Page’.</p>
<p>The following two sections refer to the Mega Menu and its elements. Add shadows to the meta info or the subcategories to make them stand out from the rest of the box. Also, just like before you can select colors and fonts for each option to go with your style. If you want your Menu to appear on top of your content, you can turn the Header into an Overlay Header by going into the Zone Settings and choosing from the &#8220;Display&#8221; drop-down menu the &#8220;Overlay&#8221; option. Read more about the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/overlay-header-newspaper-theme/">Overlay Header</a>.</p>
<h2>Bonus: the Header Categories List</h2>
<p>For a more minimalistic design, you can create a Header Categories List. It’s an icon and, on hover, it displays a list of your site’s Categories. Drag and drop the Header Categories List onto the Header to see precisely what this means.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5769 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Categories-List.jpg" alt="Header Main Menu Header Categories list" width="1200" height="725" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Categories-List.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Categories-List-300x181.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Categories-List-768x464.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Categories-List-1024x619.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Categories-List-696x421.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Categories-List-1068x645.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Header-Categories-List-695x420.jpg 695w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>You can customize it easily. Click it and go to the General Settings. Each of your Categories has a unique ID. With this shortcode, you can exclude or include different ones. You can find out the ID either from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posts &gt; Categories page &#8211; hover over the Category and look at the bottom of the screen where the word ID appears;</li>
<li>Appearance &gt; Menus &#8211; Click on the arrow and look through the Mega Menu dropdown list, and you can see the ID for each of your Categories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, back to the tagDiv Composer. After picking out the IDs for the items, you wish to display, add them in the ‘Include’ box of the General Settings. Each one has to be separated by a comma.</p>
<p>To increase the size of your list, type a higher number in the ‘Limit’ box. Now, you can continue editing and designing the element to your heart’s desire. Add padding, margins, choose fonts, and colors! Don’t forget to save your progress.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p><a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">With Newspaper Theme</a>, you can easily create the perfect navigational Menu for your audience. Add separators, contrasting colors, paddings, and margins without effort. Arrange the perfect menu straight from your WordPress Admin Dashboard and select it from the front-end editor, the tagDiv Composer. For best results, keep the style of your Header in tone with the rest of your content so that it creates a perfect transition from the top of the page to the bottom.</p>
<p>And, as always, show off your brilliant Menus in the comment box below!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Live Search on your website is an underappreciated usability function. It helps your visitors quickly access the desired content by giving results based on the input keyword and each letter typed into the form. With <a href="https://tagdiv.com/whats-new-in-newspaper-theme-9-5-update/">Newspaper Theme 9.5</a>, you get access to a brand new shortcode: the Header Live Search. Add it straight into your header and give the audience a way to access different pages of your site.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5619 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Live-Search-Lentum-Website.jpg" alt="Header Live Search" width="1200" height="607" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Live-Search-Lentum-Website.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Live-Search-Lentum-Website-300x152.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Live-Search-Lentum-Website-768x388.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Live-Search-Lentum-Website-1024x518.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Live-Search-Lentum-Website-696x352.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Live-Search-Lentum-Website-1068x540.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Live-Search-Lentum-Website-830x420.jpg 830w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>What do you do with the Header Live Search feature?</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-customize-the-header-manager/">Website Manager</a> is one of the core features of the 9.5 update of Newspaper Theme. With it, you can build and customize a website’s header from the ground up. Our team has created a series of shortcodes to accompany it. They give you the elements necessary for a fantastic layout.</p>
<p>Once you add the Header Live Search into the header, you give the audience the content they are searching for instantly. It pulls up articles, posts, pages relevant to the keyword helping them access it faster than ever before.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to do with the Live Search:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each result displayed to your readers can be customized from adding padding to the meta info to resizing the featured image for the page.</li>
<li>Create a search form that fits in with your site’s appearance (give it a background color, add a placeholder text, and many more.)</li>
<li>Add a hover animation over the results such as a shadow display or even a movement one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dive right in and explore each possibility in detail!</p>
<p><video class="td-center td-article-img-border" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="1200" height="678"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Live-Search-Animation-Hover.mp4"></video></p>
<h2>Create the Header Live Search</h2>
<p>Import a Header Template straight from the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/what-is-the-cloud-library/">tagDiv Cloud Library</a>. Now, whether you’ve chosen to import a Template or create one from the ground up, don’t forget to customize them to fit in with the rest of your website. Keep the look uniform throughout the design process.</p>
<p>To start customizing the Header Live Search shortcode, find it in the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">tagDiv Composer</a> and drag it into your Header if you haven’t done so already. Now click on it to open the settings tab. In the General Settings section, you can choose the icon that appears for the button. We advise using a magnifying glass as it is easily identifiable by the audience.</p>
<p>Click on the Show Search Form option to see how your Search Form looks. Adjust the Search Form width, the padding, border and its alignment for starters. You can also choose a text placeholder which appears in the form and then disappear as the user starts typing. Add margins, padding and type the text that appears on the button.</p>
<h2>Customize the Header Live Search</h2>
<p>In the Results Module settings, you can find options for how the results are displayed within the search form Box. The Modules per row lets you show multiple posts on a single row. This works well in case you want the Posts Limit to be a higher number. Add a hover animation for your modules in the Hover Effect drop-down menu.</p>
<p>The Meta info has many customization options: choose the padding, margins, hide or show different parts of it such as the Category, Author, Button, Date, Comment, and many more. Mix and match to see which works best for the vision you have in mind.</p>
<p><video class="td-center td-article-img-border" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="1200" height="686"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source type="video/mp4" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Live-Search-Instant-Results.mp4"></video></p>
<p>The Style settings are divided into different zones:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first section is the Search Icon. Choose the color of the icon, and if there’s text that accompanies it, you can choose the font and color of it, too.</li>
<li>Search Form is next, pick the background color, the arrow color, the border’s color if you have a border. There are also input and button options.</li>
<li>‘The View All Results’ is at the bottom of your form. This section can also be customized in the Style settings of the Search Results Box.</li>
<li>The Search Results Module deals with all the fonts, shadows, colors of the Meta info and everything contained within the displayed results box.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Newspaper Theme, you’ve got virtually unlimited options available to you. Test out designs to find the one that works best with the rest of your website.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Use the Header Live Search to display search results in real time to the audience. This helps them find what they are looking for faster and thereby creating a good user experience. Design and customize the element to fit in perfectly with the rest of your content and website. Display as many search results as you want and adjust their size accordingly.

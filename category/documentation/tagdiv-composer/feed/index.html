										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With over 5 million active installations, WooCommerce is the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/">most popular eCommerce </a>plugin and has always been compatible with the Newspaper template. For example, some websites sell a few items and keep a blog to highlight their products and share news about them. Other websites are entire tech portals that sell gadgets. Starting with <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-11/">Newspaper version 11</a>, our news theme has become more WooCommerce friendly due to the new. We’ve added new, useful shortcodes and features for WooCommerce ready for you to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-what-are-woocommerce-shortcodes">What are WooCommerce shortcodes?</h3>



<p>WooCommerce shortcodes are pieces of code that you can easily insert into your posts or pages that bring eCommerce functionality. There are a few mandatory tools that must be always included in your site: shop, cart, related products, an easy-to-use filtering system, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="588" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page.jpg" alt="Create the Picture Perfect Layout for your Front Page Shop" class="wp-image-16833" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-300x147.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-1024x502.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-768x376.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-696x341.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/create-the-perfect-shop-front-page-1068x523.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<p>Once you install WooCommerce on your site, you’ll notice that it comes with some pre-built shortcodes with the possibility to<a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/"> purchase more Woo extensions</a> and enlarge the plugin’s capabilities. However, starting with the Newspaper theme 11 update, we’ve added a new premium plugin called tagDiv Shop which is mandatory to run Shop Cloud Templates and extensive features compatible with the WooCommerce plugin. Furthermore, with the tagDiv Shop activated, you can install one of the Prebuilt eShop Websites our design team has carefully built. If you need help to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezaaE2VP7V8">install a prebuilt website design</a>, you can follow along with our video tutorial.</p>



<h2 id="h-tagdiv-shop-brings-woocommerce-functionality">tagDiv Shop Brings WooCommerce functionality</h2>



<p>We’ve crafted a dedicated plugin that brings you all the eCommerce functionality you would possibly need to run an online store.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-let-s-tackle-the-tagdiv-shop-elements">Let’s tackle the tagDiv Shop elements</h3>



<p>You’ll find the Woo elements divided into three major sections in the tagDiv Composer page builder:</p>



<ol><li>WooCommerce shortcodes that are specific to the Woo Template you are currently editing.</li><li>WooCommerce common shortcodes that can be used interchangeably on any Woo Template.</li><li>Block shortcodes &#8211; the Woo Product Block. This element can also be used on homepage, product, and category pages and you can easily add filters on it.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/integrate-your-perfect-products.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="773" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/integrate-your-perfect-products.jpg" alt="Integrate your Products flawlessly with the tagDiv Shop" class="wp-image-16834" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/integrate-your-perfect-products.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/integrate-your-perfect-products-300x193.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/integrate-your-perfect-products-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/integrate-your-perfect-products-768x495.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/integrate-your-perfect-products-696x448.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/integrate-your-perfect-products-1068x688.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<h3 id="h-woocommerce-shortcodes">WooCommerce shortcodes</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the essential elements of the Newspaper Theme is a row. It is a container that is used to put every element in coherently, one after the other. This way, it can create different types of layouts. But how does one make the row stretch all across the page or split it into columns? Let’s explore some of the basics in today’s tutorial.</p>



<h2 id="h-row-add-delete-duplicate">Row, Add, Delete, Duplicate</h2>



<p>Open a page or template with the tagDiv Composer. It can be either imported straight from the Cloud Library or crafted from scratch. Now, whenever you scroll upon various elements, you can see a blue bar appear at the top of the row with a few options.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="177" height="17" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/row-basics-icons.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15805"/></figure>



<ul><li>If you click on the row button, it will open the General Settings tab for that row.&nbsp;</li><li>The next icon duplicates the current row with all of its content and settings.</li><li>The column button behaves the same as the row button.</li><li>Whichever element you’re scrolling over can be opened by clicking on the element button.</li><li>You can also duplicate the element with the second icon in the bar.</li><li>The last icon deletes the current element you’re scrolling over.</li></ul>



<p>These icons are essential for everyday basic functionality. Acquaint yourself with them, and things will become much more manageable while editing and crafting a beautiful page.</p>



<p>To delete a row, you can also scroll over the row button, click on it and drag it to the bottom-left corner of the page. A delete pop-up will appear, asking you to confirm the deletion. The same can be done for the column and any element on the page.</p>



<h2 id="h-general-settings-tab">General Settings tab</h2>



<p>Let’s explore the first few options you can see when opening the row settings: </p>



<div class="wp-block-image td-article-img-border"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="407" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/general-settings-for-row.jpg" alt="General Settings for Rows" class="wp-image-15807" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/general-settings-for-row.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/general-settings-for-row-221x300.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>The Layout lets you split the row into multiple columns. Just click on the icon, and you can see the changes happening live.&nbsp;</li><li>Columns gap lets you increase or decrease the space between columns. All you need to do is write down a number in the box.</li><li>“Vertical align” adjusts the position of the content. From left to right, the icons adjust the content to the top, middle or bottom.</li><li>The Full height option makes the row have a set value in height.</li><li>If you check the “hide on pagination” box on templates that require multiple pages (such as Category pages), the row will be hidden.</li><li>The “Add Parallax” option applies only if you have a background image set on the row. It will move the image slowly up and down as you scroll past the row.</li><li>With the “turn off bg transition” checked, when the page loads in, if you have a background image set on the row, it loads instantly and won’t gradually fade in.</li><li>A fixed background image stays in a fixed position when the user scrolls down the page.</li><li>Choose colors and create a beautiful background with the background gradient.</li><li>The Shadow properties allow you to give the row its own shadow. The first setting lets you input the size of it. Whereas the next two options lets you offset it vertically, and horizontally. Next up is the spread &#8211; this measures how far the shadow should go. And lastly, you get to choose the color of it.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-youtube-sticky-rows">YouTube &amp; Sticky Rows</h2>



<p>The last few options left are the YouTube ID, class, and making the row sticky.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="370" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sticky-row-settings.jpg" alt="Video Background Settings for Rows" class="wp-image-15808" title="td-article-img-border" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sticky-row-settings.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sticky-row-settings-243x300.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>If you check the “Sticky” checkbox, the row keeps being displayed even if you scroll past it. The dropdown menu lets you choose whether it should be shown at the top or bottom of the page.</li><li>To give your row more life, you can add a YouTube ID in the box that will play a YouTube video automatically, muted, on loop. Pick the YouTube video you want to display and copy &amp; paste the numbers and letters that come after <strong>watch?v=&nbsp;</strong></li><li>You can also choose to start the video at a set time by inputting the number of seconds in the box.</li><li>If you want to increase the size of the video, use the scale box.</li><li>The opacity slider controls how visible the overall video will be.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-row-stretch">Row Stretch</h2>



<p>One of the most critical features for a row is its stretch capabilities. A row can stretch all the way across the page horizontally. That is something you can do through the tagDiv Composer using the stretch row dropdown menu. When you first click on it, you can see the various options presented to you:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image td-article-img-border"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="214" height="151" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stretch-row-dropdown-menu.png" alt="Stretch Row Dropdown menu" class="wp-image-15809"/></figure></div>



<ul><li>Default is 1080 pixels wide, and if you set a background color, it will be constrained within those pixels.</li><li>The stretch row keeps the 1080 pixels width but allows the background image / color to stretch across the page horizontally.</li><li>Stretch row and 1200px/1400px/1600px/1800px content adjust the row according to those sizes written.</li><li>Stretch row and content allow you to expand the row until it hits the left and right margins of the screen.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>You also get the option to “stretch row off.” Once you hit this checkbox, you can see the background color stretch to the left and right sides of the screen. This works in the same way the “Stretch Row” option does.</p>



<h2 id="h-background-image">Background Image</h2>



<p>Just as we’ve seen above, you can add background images and have the image not change position while scrolling down or gradually move up and down with parallax. However, how do you add a background image on the row? For that, we need to travel to the CSS tab.</p>



<p>Under the CSS tab, you will first meet the varying options for margins and paddings.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="272" height="222" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/paddings-and-margins-for-row-css-tab.jpg" alt="Settings for Rows: Margins and Paddings" class="wp-image-15810"/></figure></div>



<p>Each box refers to a different thing. The outermost boxes are the margins of the element, in this case, the row’s margins. The second most row, the one in the middle, is the border. Suppose you want to add a border spanning all the way across the row, you would need to input a number in each of the four second most boxes. The inner ones are padding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Underneath all of that, you can choose the style and color of the border. However, what we’re interested in, lies even further below that: the background image. If you click on the background image option, it lets you choose a photo from the media Library or upload a new one entirely. Keep in mind, if the row is stretched horizontally (using the options mentioned above) the image needs to be large enough so that it maintains its high quality.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-background-image-options">Background Image Options</h3>



<p>Background style lets you choose how the image behaves with a dropdown menu:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="123" height="87" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/background-image-repeat-on-row.jpg" alt="Background Image for Rows" class="wp-image-15811" title="td-article-img-border"/></figure></div>



<ul><li>Cover makes the image cover the entirety of the row, stretching it in various directions.</li><li>Contain shrinks or enlarges the image down to the height of the row.</li><li>No repeat places the image into the row without stretching it in any direction.</li><li>Repeat duplicates the image so that it spans all across the row.</li></ul>



<p>The background position dropdown menu affects the image placement so that it shows the middle, the bottom or even the top of it using the background style settings.</p>



<p>And the last background image option is the background opacity. If you’ve chosen an image, you can lower the image’s opacity so that it only shows a bit of it, like a silhouette.</p>



<h2 id="h-row-layout-divider">Row Layout &amp; Divider</h2>



<p>There are two more tabs when you open a row: the Divider and Layout tabs. The Divider lets you place a vector on the background of the row, creating various shapes to attract the viewer’s interest. Heaps of various geometrical forms can be achieved and maintain the contrast between different elements on the page. If you want to learn more about it, we have a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/row-divider/">Divider Tutorial<strong> </strong></a>on our blog.</p>



<p>The Layout tab covers many new features that affect the way your content is shown on the page. You can adjust the content within a column to display differently compared to the rest. Modify the order of columns for various devices, adjust the width of the row and columns, and plenty more. To explore these features, we suggest reading more about the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/flexibility-rows-columns-newspaper-theme/">Layout Options</a> on our blog.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Now that we’ve explored all the varying degrees with which you can diversify and create interesting layouts using the rows in Newspaper Theme, it’s time to put this knowledge to good use.

<p>The <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-10-3-7/">Newspaper 10.3.7 update</a> brings you new tools to craft beautiful pages for mobile devices. We know how important mobile pages are for your audiences. They must be responsive and the content adapted to the small screens. This time, we’ve redesigned and rethink the way you were creating your pages for mobile devices. Enhanced for optimization and flexibility, tagDiv Composer is the frontend page builder that makes everything possible. You can now build mobile pages and upload only the elements that are really necessary, without showing the full menu, and with all the shortcodes within your grasp. Let’s demonstrate how easy it is to create and customize mobile pages with the Newspaper theme, right on the frontend of your site!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="681" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-editing.jpg" alt="Edit the Mobile Page" class="wp-image-14322" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-editing.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-editing-300x170.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-editing-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-editing-768x436.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-editing-696x395.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mobile-editing-1068x606.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Newspaper Mobile Web Design &amp; Customizability</h2>



<p>With the tagDiv Composer page builder, you have now unlimited customization possibilities to design mobile pages. Until today, it was not possible to build mobile pages from scratch, with their own shortcodes, without all the elements shown on desktop. Newspaper 10.3.7. update allows you to create pages specially-crafted for mobile screens with stunning flexibility, and this will improve your overall page speed and page usability.</p>



<p>With the new way of creating mobile pages, you’ll definitely have the most appealing and fully-functional website. The freedom of customizing mobile pages to your liking will boost your UX and UI results. It’s the same website, but whole new experience for your visitors. It is not enough to ensure a responsive and adaptive website design that automatically resizes the content of a page or post. Starting with the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-10-3-7/">Newspaper 10.3.7 version</a>, you can mix and match elements for the mobile pages live, right on the frontend of your site.</p>



<h2>How to Create a Mobile Page with tagDiv Composer</h2>



<p>If you want to create a new mobile page, you first have to go on the website’s frontend and choose a particular page or template to edit. The main functionality of the new mobile page system can be found at the top of the screen, near the “<span style="background-color:#00a364" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Edit with TagDiv Composer</span>” tab, and it is called “<span style="background-color:#1c1d1e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Mobile Page</span> .” Here’s an example of how this should look:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="466" height="150" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/no-mobile-page-2.png" alt="No Mobile Page" class="wp-image-14294" title="" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/no-mobile-page-2.png 466w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/no-mobile-page-2-300x97.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /></figure></div>



<p>If you click on the “Mobile Page No mobile page” tab and the page does not have a mobile version, then it will appear the following message &#8220;<strong><em>No mobile page, please import or create a new mobile page</em></strong>&#8220;<strong> </strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="510" height="335" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/copy-content.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14296" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/copy-content.jpg 510w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/copy-content-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></figure></div>



<p>A new mobile page can be created by pressing the + icon at the right of the mobile page section. The newly created mobile page is blank by default, but you can check the <span style="background-color:#b5dcaf" class="td_text_highlight_marker"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span>Copy Content box below the mobile page name and hit the Create button. This option is going to copy the whole desktop content and paste it automatically into the new mobile page for easier content manipulation. Then, if you’ll open the dropdown, all the existing mobile pages for this page in particular will appear one beneath the other.</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14298" width="250" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page.jpg 1920w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-300x170.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-768x436.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-1536x871.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-696x395.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/edit-mobile-page-1068x606.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption>Click the Create Mobile Page button from the tagDiv Composer front-end pagebuilder. The Button is right beneath your Save Settings.</figcaption></figure></div></a></div>



<p>Furthermore, if you’re currently editing a page with the tagDiv Composer page builder, you can easily build a mobile template or just edit it. Below the tagDiv Composer menu, you have the page breadcrumbs, and two important sections called <span style="background-color:#c4cdd1" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Edit&nbsp;</span>and <span style="background-color:#c4cdd1" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Create Mobile Template</span></p>



<p>All the mobile templates that you’ve created can be found in the WordPress Admin Dashboard; you’ll see the mobile pages in the pages sections, and the mobile templates in the &nbsp;<span style="background-color:#2665b6" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Cloud Templates.</span></p>



<p>If you open the backend of your Newspaper website and navigate to the Pages area, you’ll see two new columns added. The Mobile Page column shows if a particular page or template has a mobile page assigned or not to it, while the Mobile Template column informs you what type of page it is (mobile or not).</p>



<h2>How to Edit The Mobile Pages</h2>



<p>If you are on the frontend of your website and open a specific page, you have to navigate to the top of the page and click on the “<span style="background-color:#373d40" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Mobile Page</span> ” tab to open the dropdown. When you hover over the wanted template, you can edit the mobile page by using the <strong>small pencil button</strong> next to the mobile page name. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="468" height="163" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-the-pencil-icon-to-edit-the-page-1.png" alt="Click the Pencil Icon to edit" class="wp-image-14307" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-the-pencil-icon-to-edit-the-page-1.png 468w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-the-pencil-icon-to-edit-the-page-1-300x104.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></figure></div>



<p>Once you press the pencil button, you will be redirected to tagDiv Composer in the editing mode. From here you can add, remove, and adjust the block elements you want to show on your mobile pages.</p>



<h2>Header and Footer for Mobile Pages</h2>



<p>Every website should have a top and bottom area. This is the nicest way to say hello and say goodbye to your visitors. Headers and footers on mobile devices should be just as appealing as the ones from your website’s desktop versions. With Newspaper Theme and the Website Manager within the tagDiv Composer page builder it’s easy to select or import a header and footer for your new mobile page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1089" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr.png" alt="Website Manager" class="wp-image-14328" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr.png 1920w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-300x170.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-1024x581.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-768x436.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-1536x871.png 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-696x395.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/website-manager-footr-1068x606.png 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h2>Coming Soon: Pre-Designed Mobile Templates in the tagDiv Cloud Library</h2>

<p>With Newspaper Theme 10.3.5 comes a whole bunch of new features for arranging your page or template’s layout. More mobility, ease of access, and faster options to move, align, and order your elements in your rows or columns. If the old school way to make advanced customizations was via the CSS box, now it’s possible to tweak those aspects by clicking some icons. Let’s learn what the new flexible rows and columns do.</p>



<h2>Layout Choices</h2>



<p>First of all, make sure you’re up-to-date with the Newspaper Theme version. If you’re new to updating your WordPress Theme, take a look at our tutorial on <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introduction-to-newspaper-theme-automatic-updates/">automatic updates</a>. Now, navigate to a page or template that you want to edit. Open the tagDiv Composer, our front-end pagebuilder. New to using the drag-and-drop editor? Discover <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">how to move and arrange elements</a> with<strong> </strong>tagDiv Composer first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Either drag-and-drop a new row into the page or just click on an already-existing one. Split the row into 2-4 different columns. Go to General and choose between the predefined column choices. You might have noticed a new tab called “Layout.” Click it to explore a whole new set of adjustments.</p>



<p>The first row contains three options:</p>



<ul><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13590" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/off-turned-on.png" alt="off-png"> &#8211; if you leave it on OFF, you deactivate the feature for the row you’re on.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13591" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/vertical-columns.png" alt="vertical columns"> &#8211; keeps the layout of the row arranged in columns vertically.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13592" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/row-columns.png" alt="row columns"> &#8211; each column gets aligned horizontally.</li></ul>



<p>Right below those, you get a checkbox to rearrange the columns in reverse order. The second option lets elements wrap inside the column, just like a text. Once you activate an option, you can see the changes happening live on the page and how your new layout looks.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Horizontal-Alignment-for-Columns.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2>Horizontal Alignment</h2>



<p>The next few settings refer to the placement of the items inside a row or column. So let’s say that you have a column with an item shorter than the total width of the column. How would you move it to the left or right side of it? You might try to add paddings or margins to the CSS settings of it. However, there’s a straightforward solution now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Click on the column you would like to modify. Now turn on the column settings ( <img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13591" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/vertical-columns.png" alt="vertical columns"> ). Right next to “Horizontal Align” are these available options:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13593" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/left-align.png" alt="left align"> &#8211; is turned ON by default and arranges all elements to the left side of the column.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="18" height="19" class="wp-image-13594" style="width: 18px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mid-align.png" alt="mid align"> &#8211; moves components to the center of the column.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13595" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/right-align.png" alt="right align"> &#8211; aligns the item on the right side of the column.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13596" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/space-evenly.png" alt="space evenly"> &#8211; works only with multiple items that are displayed on the same row and column. It distributes them to the left and right sides of the column.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13597" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dustribute-evenly.png" alt="dustribute evenly"> &#8211; just like the previous option, it only works when there are multiple elements on the same row and column. It creates an even distance between the items.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vertical-alignment-on-rows-1.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2>Vertical Alignment</h2>



<p>Do you want elements to align in the center of your row without adding unnecessary amounts of CSS? With the Vertical Alignment options, each row or column can be moved to the center, bottom, or even to the top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like with the horizontal alignment icons, there are a few icons for the vertical alignment:</p>



<ul><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13616" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/top-align.png" alt="top align">  &#8211; is turned ON by default and arranges the elements starting from the top.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="15" class="wp-image-13617" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/center-align.png" alt="center align"> &#8211; aligns the objects to the middle of the row.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13618" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bot-align.png" alt="bottom align"> &#8211; moves the items to the bottom of the row.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="10" class="wp-image-13619" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/baseline.png" alt="baseline align">  &#8211; the objects align on a horizontal line so that the text’s baseline sits on top of it.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13620" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/stretch.png" alt="stretch columns"> &#8211; this option, when turned ON on the row, makes every column equal in height to the tallest one. This is a great option to vertically align items within their columns and even to create proportionate colored backgrounds within the columns.</li></ul>



<h2>More Options, More Accessibility!</h2>



<p>The last two features for flexible rows and columns in the Layout tab are the Order and Width boxes. They allow you to control the way your content sits on the page and rearrange items differently on various devices.</p>



<h3>Order</h3>



<p>By default, it’s set on Auto, which means the columns appear one after the other exactly as you see them on the page. If you have multiple columns, at the very least 2, you can easily switch to a tablet or mobile view through the &nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="272" height="30" class="wp-image-13630" style="width: 272px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/device-bar.png" alt="device bar" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/device-bar.png 272w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/device-bar-265x30.png 265w" sizes="(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px" />&nbsp; device bar and have the columns show up in a different order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you do this? Click on the column you want to show up first and input a number. It can be any number, but for simplicity’s sake, write down 1. Now go to the second column and write down a number that’s higher than the first one; in our case, we can go from 2 to ∞. The columns should now show up with the “1” before the “2” column.</p>



<p>This is absolutely fantastic when you move to smaller devices and want your content to be the centerpiece of the website.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Width</h3>



<p>This feature works brilliantly on both the flexible rows and columns if you want to increase or decrease the amount of space they take up on the page. </p>



<p>Put in any measurement in the box, and it will increase the content accordingly. You can use pixels, percentages, points or anything as long as it is marked by the correct shortening. View a <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_measurement_units.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full list of measurements</a> here. So, if you want that column or row to increase its size, just input it in the box. </p>



<h3>Flexibility at Your Fingertips</h3>



<p>Let’s say you’ve decreased one column’s width, what happens to the rest of the columns? Most likely, they will stay at their existing width if you haven’t increased it. To make it easier, we’ve created a set of options that automatically calculate the remaining space in the row and adjust the column’s width accordingly. Let’s explore the options next to the “Occupy remaining space in row” option:</p>



<ul><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13621" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/default.png" alt="default settings"> &#8211; it is turned ON by default. It lets each column remain at the size they were when you first created the row.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13622" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/on.png" alt="turn the feature on"> &#8211; if you turn the option ON, it will adjust the column’s width to fill the rest of the row.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13590" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/off-turned-on.png" alt="off-png"> &#8211; turns the option OFF.</li></ul>



<p>Remember that this icon &nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13591" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/vertical-columns.png" alt="vertical columns">&nbsp; needs to be turned ON on the row for this feature to work properly.</p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>As with every new feature, the best part about it is implementing it creatively on your Newspaper website. With so many options and combinations, there’s plenty to explore and discover. Moreover, there’s much to be done with the new flexible rows and columns: widening columns, stretching background colors, arranging items, and organizing your site in a simple manner!&nbsp;</p>

<p>We all know that animation attracts attention; the same goes for videos which have grown in popularity over the years. Most websites nowadays have a presentation video right underneath their header, greeting you. By doing so, they’re showcasing what their company is all about in a very appealing way. But what if your website consists of reporting and delivering the people a reliable source of information? Each article would need to link to news reports, and what better way to do this than to let the audience see the news report themselves? With <a href="https://tagdiv.com/whats-new-in-newspaper-theme-10-3-2-update/">Newspaper 10.3.2</a>, you get access to a couple of new features that can invigorate your news website.</p>



<h2>Featured Video Article</h2>



<p>To first understand how these new features work, you would need to have at least one recent article with a featured Video. Open a post through the WordPress Gutenberg editor. In the document settings tab on the right side of the screen, you have multiple sections. Look for the <strong>“Featured Video”</strong> one below the Discussion tab. Open it up and type in the YouTube URL as your video source. Now hit <strong>Update </strong>or <strong>Publish</strong> to save your settings. With a Featured video, the Gutenberg editor will fetch the thumbnail. If you want to replace it, upload your image in the Featured Image section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you’re done, open the article. Having a Featured Video for your post will not only enable you to get access to the Sticky Video feature, but also the Video Pop-up one.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sticky Video</h2>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll.jpg" alt="Enable Sticky Video at Scroll" class="wp-image-12286" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll.jpg 1131w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll-300x109.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll-1024x372.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll-768x279.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll-696x253.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll-1068x388.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1131px) 100vw, 1131px" /><figcaption>Switch the Enable Sticky Video at Scroll so the button turns blue exactly like image.</figcaption></figure></div></a></div>



<p>Let’s explore how to turn on the Sticky Video feature for your new video post. Go to your Admin Dashboard and then to <strong>Newspaper &gt; Theme Panel &gt; Post Settings</strong>. With this panel open, click on the “Video Settings” tab and switch on the “Enable Sticky Video at Scroll” button. Save the settings. Great! Now your featured video post can remain sticky for your audience when they play it. How? When a viewer scrolls down the page, after clicking on the Featured Video, it appears on the left or right side of the screen as a smaller version of itself. So, your audience can continue watching the video while reading your article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This can be extremely effective in increasing the average time spent on a page or article, which in turn ranks you higher as a more trustworthy website in Google Analytics. Awesome! Now, wait just one second! Before you close this tab, check out the rest of the Sticky Video settings as they can help you decide where exactly the video should remain on the side of the screen while scrolling.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Video Settings</h2>



<p>Let’s start with the width of the sticky video. How big do you want it to show up on people’s screens? The default is set to 450px. However, you can input a different width; just make sure it’s not too small that the viewers can’t tell what’s happening, or too big and it’s taking up too much of the screen.</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Video-Settings-for-Sticky-Video.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Video-Settings-for-Sticky-Video.jpg" alt="Video Settings for Sticky Video" class="wp-image-12290" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Video-Settings-for-Sticky-Video.jpg 853w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Video-Settings-for-Sticky-Video-300x166.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Video-Settings-for-Sticky-Video-768x424.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Video-Settings-for-Sticky-Video-696x384.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /><figcaption>You can always choose different settings for your Sticky Video. Don&#8217;t forget to Save your Settings!</figcaption></figure></div></a></div>



<p>Vertical Position refers to where the video is displayed, whether it’s at the bottom or top of your screen. Whichever option you choose, the following setting alters the distance between the bottom or top of the screen to display the video. The default for it is 300px so that it can give a bit of space between the header and the footer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Horizontal Position allows you to choose which side of the screen to showcase it. And Horizontal Distance lets you add space between the margins of each side. These settings all refer to the Sticky Video that lets you continue playing the Featured YouTube Video on posts. However, just above these, you get three different new video settings:&nbsp;</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/video-player-settings.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/video-player-settings.jpg" alt="Video Player Settings" class="wp-image-12293" width="300" height="107" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/video-player-settings.jpg 848w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/video-player-settings-300x108.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/video-player-settings-768x275.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/video-player-settings-696x250.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption>Enable any of the options by clicking on the button. When the switch is blue, the feature is enabled. Save your settings when you&#8217;re done.</figcaption></figure></div></a></div>



<ul><li><strong>Play one Player</strong>: if you have multiple videos in the inside of your article, with this option enabled, there will be only one video playing at all times. It’s convenient so that the viewer does not have multiple videos playing at the same time, with audio overlapping one another.</li><li><strong>Pause Hidden Player</strong>: if an audience member clicks on a video(inside your article) then scrolls down to keep reading the rest of the post, this feature pauses the video when it’s not visible anymore.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Lazy Video on Mobile</strong>: by enabling this option, when anyone scrolls through your website on mobile, the website does not load each video embedded in the post. Instead, it brings only the thumbnail. Moreover, if the viewer decides to watch any of the videos, the site loads them when they’re clicked on. This helps reduce the data loaded for mobile devices and improves the site’s overall performance.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Enable any of these options as you want, and then save your settings to see them happening live on your website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Video-Popup-newspaper-theme-video-features.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2>Video Pop-up</h2>



<p>Your Homepage is an essential part of the website. When first creating it, you would try to tackle it in a way that makes any member of the audience listen and keep on exploring. If you’re new to creating your Homepage, we have a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-create-homepages-with-newspaper-theme/">helpful tutorial</a> about it. However, if you’ve already created and designed your website, then you most likely want to keep the changes you make to a minimum. After spending hours contemplating the layout decisions, you should sit back and hone the aspects of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as you report consequential items of news, you might need to feature a video to relate your gatherings. With Newspaper Theme’s new Video Pop-up, you can let your viewers click on a video thumbnail and have it play straight from the page they’re already on. This can either be a Contact Page, About Page, or your Homepage.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Flex Blocks &amp; Ads</h2>



<p>Whenever someone clicks on a video thumbnail on a page, the video takes the center of the screen, dimming the rest of the content and starts playing. Most importantly, the place underneath the video is suitable for advertising, which is why you can add ads to display while the user sits back and watches what’s on-screen. This is a great way to reach out and make revenue without crowding the page as it only appears when the video “pops up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s start with the beginning. Open up your Homepage, or any other page for that matter,&nbsp; with the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">tagDiv Composer</a>. Now scroll through the page and click on the first Flex Block you find. If you can’t spot one, you can always drag and drop the element from the list. Navigate to the Layout Settings and scroll down until you’re at the <strong>Article Video</strong> section. Right beneath it, you have your video pop-up settings. First of all, you need to make sure the box that says “Enable Video Pop-up” is checked. This will make it so a reader can click on a video thumbnail and have it play instantly.&nbsp;</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block.jpg" alt="How to Enable Video Pop-up" class="wp-image-12298" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block.jpg 1492w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block-300x133.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block-1024x453.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block-768x340.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block-696x308.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block-1068x472.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1492px) 100vw, 1492px" /><figcaption>Make sure to click the &#8220;Enable Video Pop-up&#8221; box just like in the image. Write your Google AdSense or Affiliation code in the square container.</figcaption></figure></div></a></div>



<p>The video icon size refers to the play button and how small or big you want it to show. Video duration settings let you display how long the video is, if you have the option enabled. The big “Video pop-up ad” box is essential for advertising. This is where you write your Google Adsense code or your Affiliates code to display horizontally below the playing video. The images displayed should be broad and narrow in height. When you write your code, you can hit Save and check out your new video settings. Click on any video thumbnail to see how it instantly opens up, dimming the rest of the content, and showcases your written ad code underneath. Pretty neat, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Follow the same steps for any Flex block you have on your pages, and you’re good to go!</p>



<h2>Enliven your Website with Video Features</h2>



<p>Adopt the new Video Pop-up feature for your Flex Blocks, or enable the Sticky Video for your articles and posts to enrich the viewer’s experience while browsing through your website. Become a valuable news source for your audience with these new features.

<p>The success of a website depends on various aspects, such as the overall usability, visual design, and brand consistency. These impact the opinion users have of your site. Can they quickly find their way around? Help them navigate by having a clean and engaging footer with Newspaper Theme. Designing a beautiful one is easy to do with our frontend page builder, the tagDiv Composer. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="320" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme.jpg" alt="Footer with Newspaper Theme Newsletter" class="wp-image-6086" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-300x80.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-768x205.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-1024x273.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-696x186.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-1068x285.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>How to create a Footer with Newspaper Theme</h2>



<p>Open the tagDiv Composer frontend builder on any of your pages or Cloud Library Templates. Click on the Manager button on the top bar of your Composer. As an alternative, you can click the button in the middle of your Composer that says “Website Manager.” Whichever option you choose, a window should show up containing not only the Footer settings but also the Header ones. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="466" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/import-footer-templates.jpg" alt="Import Footer Templates by clicking on the &quot;Import Footer&quot; button" class="wp-image-10882" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/import-footer-templates.jpg 400w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/import-footer-templates-258x300.jpg 258w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></figure></div>



<p>Under the “Choose Footer Template,” click on the “Import Footer” button. This brings up the Cloud Library from which you can import a pre-designed Footer template, or make your own. Pick the one you want and then hit <strong>“Import.”</strong> You now have your own footer that you can customize on the front end. Change the links, choose a fitting description, upload your Logo Image, and customize the colors to fit your website’s color palette. You’re done! Hit “Save” and your new footer should be applied on the page or template you created it on. </p>



<p>To set the footer globally, go to your WordPress Admin Dashboard &gt; Newspaper’s Theme Panel &gt; Footer. Now, from the first section, choose the imported footer that you’ve just finished customizing and save.</p>



<h2>A blank new Footer to fit your vision</h2>



<p>Just like you previously imported a pre-designed template, you can import a blank one. Open the tagDiv Composer and hit the “Website Manager” button. From the new window, press the “Import Footer” button, which opens the tagDiv Cloud Library. Now choose the “Blank Footer Template,” and you can begin editing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border td-caption-align-https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer.jpg" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="426" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer.jpg" alt="Import a beautiful footer from the tagDiv Cloud Library" class="wp-image-10660" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer-300x107.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer-1024x364.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer-768x273.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer-696x247.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/beauty-pro-footer-1068x379.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>Split the row into columns if you want. Now, start by bringing items to the footer zone. Don’t clutter it with too many elements. Organize each one with purpose and group them to create structure and a neat layout. After all, the first rule for editing and designing is “simple is better.”</p>



<p>Here are a few elements you could add to the footer straight from the tagDiv Composer:</p>



<ul><li>A List Menu.</li><li>Column Title</li><li>Social Icons</li><li>Inline Text / Column Text</li><li>Instagram</li><li>Header Logo</li><li>Newsletter</li><li>Call-to-Action / Button</li></ul>



<p>Get creative with each element to make it fit perfectly into your website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube alignwide wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="How to Import the New Footer Templates with Newspaper WordPress Theme" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nE51MfLV7hE?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2>Let’s get more specific</h2>



<p>Each link you add to the footer can be adjusted to match the layout of your site. With the List Menu element, create a ‘Footer Menu’ straight from the WordPress Dashboard &gt; Appearance &gt; Menus. Add links to the Contact, and Privacy Policy pages as these are essential for your footer navigation.</p>



<p>Using the Inline Text or Column Text element, write the email address, phone number, and the physical address of your company so that visitors can reach out to you conveniently. Include links to your social media through the Social Icons element. Adjust the icons’ size so they can still be visible. After all, footer items tend to be smaller than their content – counterpart.</p>



<p>A copyright notice is a lifesaver for everyone. It can be included by adding the Inline Text element and can include the circular “c” symbol. The year of publication and name of the copyright owner should also be mentioned.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border td-caption-align-https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink.jpg" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="382" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink.jpg" alt="Footer with Newspaper Theme IamThiLink" class="wp-image-6083" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink-300x96.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink-768x244.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink-1024x326.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink-696x222.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/footers-with-newspaper-theme-iamthilink-1068x340.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Encourage Interaction in the Footer with Newspaper Theme</h2>



<p>Once visitors reach the footer, give them something to do while they’re there. Include a Subscription box if you intend to deliver updates by email, or use the Call-to-Action element to invite them to a different page and continue scrolling through the content.</p>



<p>Remember: fonts in the footer have to be smaller than the ones used by the page’s body. Think about the color you use for the background and text, create contrast so that each line is noticeable. For more information on choosing appropriate fonts, check out our<a href="https://tagdiv.com/typography-guide-101-basics-tips-ideas-inspiration/"> typography blog post here</a>.</p>



<p>Spacing is essential for the layout of your footer. Leave plenty of room for each section so that lines aren’t too cramped or uninviting. Think in terms of hierarchy: what do you want the visitors to notice first? Your company’s logo or the subscription box? Make the most important element stand out from the rest. You can do that by changing size on the element, adding padding and margins to the column, row, or individual items in your footer.</p>



<p>When you’re done, hit Save. If you want to assign the footer globally, go to your WordPress Admin Dashboard &gt; Newspaper Theme Panel &gt; Footer. Now choose your new template from the dropdown menu list in the first panel.</p>

<h2>Make multiple footers for different pages / templates</h2>



<p>Whether you need a different layout, or you want to entice the reader with a different offer, you might need to create a new footer. But how does this work with the new template system? It’s simple! Just as you would create <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-customize-the-header-manager/">multiple headers</a> with the Website Manager, you do the same with footers.</p>



<p>Open the page or template you want to assign a different footer other than your global one. From the tagDiv Composer, click on “Website Manager” and in the footer section, choose the one you want to assign from the dropdown menu. Now hit Save, and you’re done! Your page or template now has a different footer.</p>



<p>You can do this multiple times. With Newspaper Theme, you can have a myriad of footers at your disposal. However, it is best to consider that if you have multiple different footers with clearly unique styles, it may distract your reader.</p>



<p>Instead, you could use a different footer on landing pages that are meant to keep a different aspect compared to the rest of your website already. This is a brilliant idea as it allows you to include different links entirely for just this one page.</p>



<h2>No Footer? No problem!</h2>



<p>Do you have a page that is cluttered with millions of different elements? If you want the reader only to pay attention to the content of the page, getting rid of the footer entirely might help your cause. How would you do that? Just open the tagDiv Composer on the page or template in question.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border td-caption-align-https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-critic-footer.jpg" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="352" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-critic-footer.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10664" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-critic-footer.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-critic-footer-300x88.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-critic-footer-1024x300.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-critic-footer-768x225.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-critic-footer-696x204.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-critic-footer-1068x313.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>Press the “Manager” button at the top of the tagDiv Composer to open the Website Manager. From the footer section, choose the “No Footer” option in the dropdown menu. That’s it! That’s all you have to do. Don’t forget to Save it!</p>



<p>This fantastic new option comes in handy when you need to keep the audience on a specific page or template.</p>



<h2>Last but not least&#8230;</h2>



<p>Newspaper Theme helps you get a clean design for the footer. However, give the audience what they want in terms of usability: links. Keep the Contact Page and Privacy Policy at the top as they are essential for any footer. The Copyright notice should be on a separate row, usually underneath the other elements as a mention to the rightful owner of the website and the publication date. Invite your audience to interact further with you through Social Network links, a subscription box, or a Call-to-Action. Lastly, resize and group items while keeping the layout spacious and neat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the arrival of Newspaper 10, so comes the arrival of a new feature straight into the Flex Block’s Settings panel. Get the magic of Photoshop layer blending modes straight into your tagDiv Composer, with no editing skills needed. The new “Blending Modes” uses advanced CSS to give you a spark of magic on every page made. Everything is done on the front-end of your browser! Turn your simple images into a wow-factor for your audience with this new feature.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-10111 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/beauty-blogger-using-blending-modes.jpg" alt="Develop your own aesthetic with the new Blending Modes" width="1200" height="567" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/beauty-blogger-using-blending-modes.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/beauty-blogger-using-blending-modes-300x142.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/beauty-blogger-using-blending-modes-768x363.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/beauty-blogger-using-blending-modes-1024x484.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/beauty-blogger-using-blending-modes-696x329.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/beauty-blogger-using-blending-modes-1068x505.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/beauty-blogger-using-blending-modes-889x420.jpg 889w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>How do the Blending Modes work?</h2>
<p>If you add a background color behind an image and then use a new CSS property, you get a mix between the color and the image. Choose the type of effect you need, whether it’s color, screen, multiply, overlay, hue, lighten, darken, hard-light, saturation, color-burn, color-dodge, difference, exclusion, or luminosity.</p>
<p>The result is composed of the value between the foreground and backdrop. It is an overlap between each pixel of the image and the color chosen. The tagDiv team has added this code straight into the backend of your Newspaper Theme, so you don’t have to do it yourself.</p>
<h2>How do you use the new Blending Modes?</h2>
<p>Open our front-end page builder, the tagDiv Composer, on an existing or new page. Drag and drop “Flex Block 1” and then navigate to the “Style” settings panel. Scroll down to the “Image Effects / Blend Modes” section. This is where the fun begins.</p>
<p>The first line allows you to specify a color or gradient for the backdrop, and then picking one of the blend modes from the dropdown menu gives your block a whole new look! Moreover, you get three new settings that alter the appearance of the photos the brightness, contrast, and saturation sliders. If you drag one of the sliders to the left or right, you can see how they affect the photo. Should you want to go back to normal, all you have to do is drag the slider back to the numerical value of “1”, and choose “Off” from the blend modes dropdown menu.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-10105 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Seek-out-the-new-Blending-Modes.jpg" alt="Discover what each Blending Mode does!" width="1200" height="900" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Seek-out-the-new-Blending-Modes.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Seek-out-the-new-Blending-Modes-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Seek-out-the-new-Blending-Modes-768x576.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Seek-out-the-new-Blending-Modes-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Seek-out-the-new-Blending-Modes-80x60.jpg 80w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Seek-out-the-new-Blending-Modes-265x198.jpg 265w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Seek-out-the-new-Blending-Modes-696x522.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Seek-out-the-new-Blending-Modes-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Seek-out-the-new-Blending-Modes-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>The second part of this section refers to the image effects on hover. However, this is only available for the desktop version of your website. It improves your overall page speed. So go ahead and test it out!</p>
<h2>Reasons behind using Blend Modes</h2>
<p>How does this all benefit you? Let’s answer that question:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have multiple images of varying colors and contrasts, you can add a Blend Mode effect to them and match the rest of your website’s hues.</li>
<li>With the rise of <a href="https://tagdiv.com/gradients-in-web-design-newspaper-theme/">Gradients as a web design trend,</a> add more color to each image by creating a gradient overlay.</li>
<li>If you have text overlapping any images, you can make it easily readable by separating it from its background with the new blend modes.</li>
<li>No need to spend hours editing your Featured Images in Photoshop, you can now do it all on the front-end of your website! No Photoshop knowledge required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still not convinced? Then take a look at how easy it was to obtain this beautiful result by watching the following video.</p>
<p><iframe class="td-extend-video td-article-img-border" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ozMV6U6Vr5k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>Test, experiment, and have fun!</h2>
<p>Each blend mode modifies the overall result differently. Test all of them to find the perfect result. Keep in mind that the color or gradient you choose also alters the way a blend mode works. So, modify the colors for each blend mode to discover how it changes the value of every pixel. You can also use the sliders to get the exact photo you want.</p>
<p>Moreover, the new blend mode settings appear not only on Flex Blocks, but also on Flex Grids, Featured Article Images, Category Background Images, Inline Single Image, and Single Images. Create a beautiful page or template with <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newspaper Theme </a>within just a few clicks! Become a photo editing Master in no time, all on the front-end of your website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you need to showcase multiple images in a gallery-like display? There are quite a few options to get the intended result. Scroll through Newspaper Theme’s front-end page builder, the tagDiv Composer, until you find these three elements: the Image Box, the Image Info Box, and Title over Image. Each one can achieve the intended result differently, so which one do you pick?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7632 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Box.jpg" alt="Newspaper Theme the tagDiv Image Box" width="1200" height="514" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Box.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Box-300x129.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Box-768x329.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Box-1024x439.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Box-696x298.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Box-1068x457.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Box-981x420.jpg 981w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Presenting the tagDiv Image Box element</h2>
<p>When you first drag this element into an open row, you’re going to be faced with 3 grayed out boxes that need to be fitted in with content. How do you do that? Click on the element and in the “Images” tab, upload 3 &#8211; 4 photos. If you want to add a title to the images, write it in the “Custom Title” box. Attach a link your audience can click on, or maybe use it to link to the source and credit the photo.</p>
<p>From the “General” tab, alter the gap between the images. Increase the space between to create wider blank space, or altogether get rid of it by typing “0.” From the “Box Style” dropdown menu of the tagDiv Image Box, you can change the presentation. “White box” displays the photo’s title in a white box in the center of your image, whereas the “With Border” sets a dark overlay on top of the photo to make the title more visible. Moreover, from the “Layout” menu, choose either “Horizontal” or “Vertical” and the photos can appear one after the other or one above the other.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7633 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Info-Box.jpg" alt="Newspaper Theme Image Info Box" width="1200" height="423" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Info-Box.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Info-Box-300x106.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Info-Box-768x271.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Info-Box-1024x361.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Info-Box-696x245.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Info-Box-1068x376.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Newspaper-Theme-Image-Info-Box-1191x420.jpg 1191w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Add a call-to-action to your photo with the Image Info Box</h2>
<p>It’s easy to capture the interest of the readers with this <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">tagDiv Composer</a> element and it also works exceptionally well with a product or service you wish to sell. Drag and drop the Image Info Box into a page to start. From the “General” tab, upload the image and adjust its height. Add a title, the description of the product or photo, and then write a call-to-action.</p>
<p>“Buy now,” “Read More,” “Download” are all great call-to-actions. What is your product or service? What do you want the users to do with it? Compose a compelling line in the “Button text” box, and then you can see it alongside the title and description.</p>
<p>In the “Style” tab, change the design. If you leave it on “Animated,” the call-to-action pops up on hover only, whereas if you choose “default,” it’ll be a static one. Make adjustments to the various colors here: the overlay, title, description, borders, button, and many more. From the “Button Style” dropdown menu, <a href="https://tagdiv.com/a-guide-to-avoid-web-design-mistakes/">choose the appearance of your box</a>. For example, “Circle animation” has a circle enlarge itself on the background of the button upon hover. Choose whatever feels right for your website and to your branding.</p>
<p><video class="td-center td-article-img-border" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="1200" height="510"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Title-Over-Image-Video.mp4"></video></p>
<h2>Introduce the Image’s Author with the Title over Image element</h2>
<p>Effortlessly credit someone’s work through Newspaper Theme. With the “Title over Image” set into a page, click on it to open the General Settings tab. From here, you can write the title of the photo and in the “subtitle text” box, add the name of its creator. Upload the photo, choose its size, and uncheck the “Show Title only on hover” box to have its text only appear when the reader puts his cursor over it.</p>
<p>In the “Style” tab, you can access various design adjustments. What color do you want the title and subtitle to be? You may need an overlay gradient or solid over the photo to make it more visible against the contrast of the image. How about you add an overlay only upon hover? This way it shows when the text appears. Adjust its opacity, <a href="https://tagdiv.com/typography-guide-101-basics-tips-ideas-inspiration/">choose the typefaces</a>, and you’re done!</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>What type of gallery do you plan to showcase? Do you need to display a series of products, multiple images in a row, or want to credit the source? Whatever the case may be, you can find the perfect solution for each situation with tagDiv Composer’s elements from <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609">Newspaper Theme</a>. Now you know how to best use the tagDiv Image Box, Title over Image, and Image info Box elements.</p>

<h2>Create perfect ads with the new “Ad Box” element</h2>
<p>Open any page or template with the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/" rel="noopener">tagDiv Composer</a>, our front-end page builder, and add the “Ad Box” element in any spot you want. Click on it to access the settings. In the General panel, you can write a title for the image and choose the color of the text and its font. If you’ve been running ads before the addition of this shortcode, you can choose which “ad spot” to use from the General Settings tab, too.</p>
<p>In the “Image Ad” tab, you have the option to upload images for various devices such as tablet landscape, tablet portrait, and phone. So, if you have specific images that vary in sizes on each device, set them from this tab. If the same photo needs to be set for all screens, then upload it in the “All Devices” section.</p>

<h2>Explore it further</h2>
<p>Next up is the “Ad URL” field, where you should write the business or affiliate website link to send your users to when they click on the “Ad Box.” You can check the box below this setting to have the URL open in a new window. Choose the type of link from the “Spot URL rel”:</p>
<ul>
<li>None</li>
<li>Nofollow</li>
<li>Noreferrer</li>
<li>Noopener</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the link type is set to “none.” The next 4 boxes can be checked to hide the ad on various devices. The next setting changes how your ad is displayed: you can choose the maximum width of the image and then change the value in the box for each device through tagDiv Composer’s device tabs. Find out more about the device tabs <a href="https://tagdiv.com/category/documentation/">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a code for the ad, navigate to the “Custom Ad” tab. Paste the text into the box you find there. From the “CSS” tab, you can make further adjustments to the Ad Box by giving it padding, margins, or even a border. Explore each setting to get the desired look!</p>

<h2>Why you should use the new “Ad Box” element</h2>
<p>With the new Ad Box, you upload an image and type a link. Monetization with affiliate marketing for different organizations and businesses can now easily be implemented. Your custom ads from Theme Panel can also be chosen, too! Just drag and drop the element onto the desired spot and select your custom ad.</p>
<p>You can copy the Google AdSense codes straight onto the front-end editing section and make modifications to the ad’s placement with ease:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the ad in its own separate row.</li>
<li>Drag it onto the sidebar of your page or template.</li>
<li>Adjust the paddings and margins of the element to fit into your layout.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, do remember that the <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1346295?hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google AdSense policy</a> restricts the use of ads on “sticky” or “floating” blocks. So don’t put your Ad Box on a sticky sidebar if you want to use Google AdSense.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>With each <a href="https://tagdiv.com/whats-new-in-newspaper-theme-9-5-update/">update</a> to the <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newspaper Theme</a>, you get brand new features that aim to make any design job effortless.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For artistic websites that have a ton of beautiful images on various pages, a minimalistic Header is the perfect support for your content. Newspaper Theme&#8217;s Header Builder can help you strike a great balance between bold visuals and minimal fonts with an Overlay Header. What’s more, fashion, beauty, creative magazines can employ this type of look for a multitude of pages.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6675 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like.jpg" alt="what an Overlay Header looks like" width="1200" height="550" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like-300x138.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like-768x352.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like-1024x469.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like-696x319.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like-1068x490.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-an-Overlay-Header-looks-like-916x420.jpg 916w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Welcome the Overlay Header</h2>
<p>Do you have a page or template with a beautiful color added to the background or an image that stretches across the screen? A Single Post Template that has a Background Featured Image, a page with a wide <a href="https://tagdiv.com/try-new-flexible-big-grids-with-newspaper-theme/">Flexible Big Grid</a> or <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-flex-block-elements/">Block</a>, and even one with a Hero element on it can be the perfect start.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Don’t use an Overlay Header on a blank page or template as your content gets pushed underneath each element contained within your header: the Live Search, Logo, and even Navigational Menu.</p>
<p>If you’re new to creating a Header then read <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-customize-the-header-manager/">this blog post</a> first to find out how to use the Header Builder.</p>
<p>Ready to start? Then open the tagDiv Composer and go to the Header Menu Zone settings. At the bottom, from the “Display” drop-down menu, choose the “Overlay” option. As long as you don’t have a set background to your header, it becomes transparent. Does it look exactly as you imagined it, too? Make any further adjustments to the text colors and fonts and you’re done! This Header gets applied to the page you opened up as soon as you hit save.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6774 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid.jpg" alt="Overlay Header with a Flex Grid" width="1200" height="588" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-300x147.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-768x376.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-1024x502.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-324x160.jpg 324w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-533x261.jpg 533w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-696x341.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-1068x523.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Overlay-Header-with-a-Flex-Grid-857x420.jpg 857w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Layout and Style of an Overlay Header</h2>
<p>For a great user experience, especially when you apply an Overlay Header on a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/customize-articles-with-single-post-templates/">Single Post Template</a>, add an overlay gradient on top of the image that is under the header. This way, when your visitors navigate to a different article with another featured image so that the menu’s text can be easily read.</p>
<p>You can get a clean look for the page by using a sans-serif font in the header. After you’ve chosen the font, you can move on to your Mobile Header. Add the Logo, Mobile Menu, and Mobile Live Search elements to the header. For more information, check out this <a href="https://tagdiv.com/mobile-header-newspaper-theme/">blog post here</a>.</p>
<p>Hit Save and you can easily import the header on other pages of your website. However, we advise you not to set it as your site-wide template. An <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-cloud-library-archive-templates/">archive page</a> or even a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introducing-new-404-page-templates/">404 Template</a> will have the text overlapping the menu. For stunning results, make it unique and use it sparingly.</p>

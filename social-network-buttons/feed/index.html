					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://tagdiv.com/social-network-buttons/#comment-54537&quot;&gt;Paata&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi,

The theme by default can only display the WordPress comments. With plugins perhaps it is possible to display other types of comments, but we don&#039;t have a guide I could provide for implementing them unfortunately. Try searching the forum for similar topics, as there may be solutions or suggestions that you could follow https://forum.tagdiv.com/forum/newspaper/ Sorry for any inconvenience.

Thank you!]]></description>

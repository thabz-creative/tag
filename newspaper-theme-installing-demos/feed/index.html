					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-installing-demos/#comment-63631&quot;&gt;Harry&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Harry, 

Thank you for reaching out to us. It depends whether you have overwritten the existing pages and posts that were included with the demos or if you have created new posts and pages. This situation might be the case if you have marked the &quot;Include Content&quot; option when you&#039;ve installed the theme. However, there&#039;s a way to save your work before switching to a new demo. Can you please send us an email at contact@tagdiv.com so our support team can guide through this process? Unfortunately, the Blog area is not associated with the Customer Support Department. Thank you so much for understanding!]]></description>

Hi Francesco, 

Thank you for reaching out and for your given interest. The whole functionality of the Newspaper WordPress theme is given by the tagDiv Composer. Our frontend page builder allows you to design and customize pages and posts using the live editing tool. Also, it gives you access to the tagDiv Cloud Library, which is a huge gallery of pre-made layouts you can edit on the frontend. We do not recommend the usage of another page builder, as most of the strong features of the Newspaper theme won&#039;t be available to work with. If you have more pre-sale questions, please let us know by email at contact@tagdiv.com. Thank you for understanding!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I&#039;d like to buy this theme for a project of one of my clients, but prior to do that I&#039;d like to figure out how to adapt it to our needs.
May I uninstall TagDiv to use another page builder?
Best regards,

Francesco]]></description>

Hi, 

Thank you for reaching out. If the installing buttons are grey, it seems that not all the required plugins are installed and activated. Some demos require the tagDiv Newsletter plugin (or others) to be installed prior to their installation. If you need any help, please let us know via forum or by email, as the Blog area is not associated with the Customer Support Department. We&#039;re always ready to assist you! Thank you so much for understanding.]]></description>

Hi Sunil,

Thank you for your interest. The CSS modifications from a theme are not transferable to another WordPress theme as the CSS files and styles are different. If you have more pre-sale questions, please drop us an email at contact@tagdiv.com. We&#039;re happy to help! Have a lovely day ahead :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So the documentation says: 

The 7 Fully Customizable Demos are Gaming, Lifestyle Blog, Gossip, Fast News, Entertainment, Living Mag, and Journal. They have been created by our dedicated design team and you can easily import them right on your website.

How to do that? In the Newspaper Theme Panel, click on the Demo you like and choose whether to bring the prepackaged Sample Content. Click the install button. Now, take a look at your newly-redesigned website!

When I click on the Theme Panel, there is no menu item for Demos.   What do I do?]]></description>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The homepage is the core of your website. It’s the starting point of the audience’s journey through your website, storage of vital links and data, a strategic asset for marketing goals. Most often, the homepage is the first visual and emotional touch that visitors have with your content and products. Fortunately, building homepages with Newspaper Theme is easy as a game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-5114 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper.jpg" alt="Homepages with Newspaper Theme" width="1200" height="500" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-300x125.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-768x320.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-1024x427.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-696x290.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-1068x445.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/homepages-across-newspaper-1008x420.jpg 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>Homepages with Newspaper Theme</h2>
<p>If you’re creating your first website, remember to use clear structures for their homepages. Here are some important elements you can add to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headline &#8211; a short statement that reflects what the website’s all about</li>
<li>A hero element with simple imagery that should inspire your visitors to interact further</li>
<li>Call-to-action that draws the attention and uses active language</li>
<li>Present your blog content through Flex Grids and Blocks</li>
<li><a href="https://tagdiv.com/newsletter-plugin/">Newsletter subscription box</a> to attract more readers to follow and keep up-to-date with your content</li>
<li>Good navigation elements such as links in the menu to take the users easily across the website, a search function, and social network buttons</li>
<li>Testimonials to increase your credibility</li>
<li>A section with team members to help readers build an emotional connection with you</li>
</ul>
<p>These are popular elements for any Homepage. However, it should not be a limit to you, as you can always add more sections and items. Homepages with Newspaper Theme? The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p><video class="td-center td-article-img-border" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="1200" height="632"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source type="video/mp4" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Homepage.mp4"></video></p>
<h2>Homepage Templates</h2>
<p>Your goals are essential when you start out. Do you want to dabble in e-commerce? Are you going to use the site as a blog? Or, maybe, showcase your portfolio of works and creative products. You should know the answer before starting the process and design the website to best serve that purpose.</p>
<p>Newspaper Theme offers a variety of Homepage designs to choose from to begin easily. From the WordPress Admin Dashboard, open the Cloud Templates section and click on the “Add New” button. You will be greeted with a digital library of our designers’ creations, with over a thousand templates; from Article, Author, and <a href="https://tagdiv.com/find-whats-new-category-templates/">Category Page Templates</a> to <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introducing-new-404-page-templates/">404 Page Error ones</a>, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Choose the Homepage tab and scroll down to see each design. Click on the one that catches your eye to see a live preview of it, or import it directly to your website. After the import is over, &nbsp;make it a part of your vision! Edit and customize each element to your heart’s desire and create something brand new.</p>
<h2>Make your Custom Homepage</h2>
<p>In your Admin Dashboard, navigate to the Pages section and click on the “Add New” button. Give the page a title such as Index or Homepage. Save the page. Press the “tagDiv Composer” button to access the front-end editing section.</p>
<p>Let’s make an efficient yet beautiful Homepage. Add a Hero Element by dragging and dropping it onto the blank page. The item has a default appearance and settings, so click on it to open the settings and customize it to perfection! Write a short description of your site’s purpose and draw the readers in through a short Title.</p>
<p><video class="td-center td-article-img-border" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="1200" height="686"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source type="video/mp4" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Create-your-own-homepage-with-Newspaper-Theme.mp4"></video></p>
<p>For content-heavy websites, the general advice is to add a Flex Grid and Flex Block to display all of your relevant posts and articles. However, the decision is in your hands.</p>
<p>If you want to interact with your audience further, add a Row with the Team Member Element. This gives you the possibility to showcase everyone contributing to your website, from authors to designers. Include a description for each member to allow the visitors to build an emotional connection with you.</p>
<h2>Creation, design, perfection</h2>
<p>Keep the layout nice and simple. Here’s a tip: create gaps between sections using white space to help your visitors navigate through the page easily. Add relevant information on the homepage such as a small showcase of your products, testimonials from clients, ads to monetize your site, buttons that invite your readers to engage further. The sky is the limit on what you can create!</p>
<p>Each element that you add on the page with the tagDiv Composer can be clicked on to customize even further. Choose font families in accordance with your vision. Color palettes are great to maintain through each page and the entire website.</p>
<p>For example, for a non-profit organization whose goal is to stop deforestation, their site’s color palette could be browns and greens to inspire the idea of trees and nature. Think of a travel beach resort website. They might use blues and yellows to represent the sun and the blue summer sky and help you immerse yourself in the dream vacation they want to portray. So, pick them to serve your goal.</p>
<p><iframe class="td-extend-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2GKDrpdzfVg" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>Invest your creativity into your Homepage</h2>
<p>If you either build the homepage from the ground up or use one from the Cloud Library and modify it to fit your website’s core, <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609">Newspaper Theme</a> brings you countless customization possibilities. Design and create any layout for the page to connect and engage with your audience.</p>
<p>With an amazing user experience, any homepage is successful. So design the homepages with Newspaper Theme based on a good interaction between your visitors and your site. Show us in the comments what your Homepage looks like and be an inspiration for the whole community! ?</p>

<p>One of the essential elements of the Newspaper Theme is a row. It is a container that is used to put every element in coherently, one after the other. This way, it can create different types of layouts. But how does one make the row stretch all across the page or split it into columns? Let’s explore some of the basics in today’s tutorial.</p>



<h2 id="h-row-add-delete-duplicate">Row, Add, Delete, Duplicate</h2>



<p>Open a page or template with the tagDiv Composer. It can be either imported straight from the Cloud Library or crafted from scratch. Now, whenever you scroll upon various elements, you can see a blue bar appear at the top of the row with a few options.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="177" height="17" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/row-basics-icons.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15805"/></figure>



<ul><li>If you click on the row button, it will open the General Settings tab for that row.&nbsp;</li><li>The next icon duplicates the current row with all of its content and settings.</li><li>The column button behaves the same as the row button.</li><li>Whichever element you’re scrolling over can be opened by clicking on the element button.</li><li>You can also duplicate the element with the second icon in the bar.</li><li>The last icon deletes the current element you’re scrolling over.</li></ul>



<p>These icons are essential for everyday basic functionality. Acquaint yourself with them, and things will become much more manageable while editing and crafting a beautiful page.</p>



<p>To delete a row, you can also scroll over the row button, click on it and drag it to the bottom-left corner of the page. A delete pop-up will appear, asking you to confirm the deletion. The same can be done for the column and any element on the page.</p>



<h2 id="h-general-settings-tab">General Settings tab</h2>



<p>Let’s explore the first few options you can see when opening the row settings: </p>



<div class="wp-block-image td-article-img-border"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="407" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/general-settings-for-row.jpg" alt="General Settings for Rows" class="wp-image-15807" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/general-settings-for-row.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/general-settings-for-row-221x300.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>The Layout lets you split the row into multiple columns. Just click on the icon, and you can see the changes happening live.&nbsp;</li><li>Columns gap lets you increase or decrease the space between columns. All you need to do is write down a number in the box.</li><li>“Vertical align” adjusts the position of the content. From left to right, the icons adjust the content to the top, middle or bottom.</li><li>The Full height option makes the row have a set value in height.</li><li>If you check the “hide on pagination” box on templates that require multiple pages (such as Category pages), the row will be hidden.</li><li>The “Add Parallax” option applies only if you have a background image set on the row. It will move the image slowly up and down as you scroll past the row.</li><li>With the “turn off bg transition” checked, when the page loads in, if you have a background image set on the row, it loads instantly and won’t gradually fade in.</li><li>A fixed background image stays in a fixed position when the user scrolls down the page.</li><li>Choose colors and create a beautiful background with the background gradient.</li><li>The Shadow properties allow you to give the row its own shadow. The first setting lets you input the size of it. Whereas the next two options lets you offset it vertically, and horizontally. Next up is the spread &#8211; this measures how far the shadow should go. And lastly, you get to choose the color of it.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-youtube-sticky-rows">YouTube &amp; Sticky Rows</h2>



<p>The last few options left are the YouTube ID, class, and making the row sticky.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="370" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sticky-row-settings.jpg" alt="Video Background Settings for Rows" class="wp-image-15808" title="td-article-img-border" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sticky-row-settings.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sticky-row-settings-243x300.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>If you check the “Sticky” checkbox, the row keeps being displayed even if you scroll past it. The dropdown menu lets you choose whether it should be shown at the top or bottom of the page.</li><li>To give your row more life, you can add a YouTube ID in the box that will play a YouTube video automatically, muted, on loop. Pick the YouTube video you want to display and copy &amp; paste the numbers and letters that come after <strong>watch?v=&nbsp;</strong></li><li>You can also choose to start the video at a set time by inputting the number of seconds in the box.</li><li>If you want to increase the size of the video, use the scale box.</li><li>The opacity slider controls how visible the overall video will be.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-row-stretch">Row Stretch</h2>



<p>One of the most critical features for a row is its stretch capabilities. A row can stretch all the way across the page horizontally. That is something you can do through the tagDiv Composer using the stretch row dropdown menu. When you first click on it, you can see the various options presented to you:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image td-article-img-border"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="214" height="151" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stretch-row-dropdown-menu.png" alt="Stretch Row Dropdown menu" class="wp-image-15809"/></figure></div>



<ul><li>Default is 1080 pixels wide, and if you set a background color, it will be constrained within those pixels.</li><li>The stretch row keeps the 1080 pixels width but allows the background image / color to stretch across the page horizontally.</li><li>Stretch row and 1200px/1400px/1600px/1800px content adjust the row according to those sizes written.</li><li>Stretch row and content allow you to expand the row until it hits the left and right margins of the screen.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>You also get the option to “stretch row off.” Once you hit this checkbox, you can see the background color stretch to the left and right sides of the screen. This works in the same way the “Stretch Row” option does.</p>



<h2 id="h-background-image">Background Image</h2>



<p>Just as we’ve seen above, you can add background images and have the image not change position while scrolling down or gradually move up and down with parallax. However, how do you add a background image on the row? For that, we need to travel to the CSS tab.</p>



<p>Under the CSS tab, you will first meet the varying options for margins and paddings.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="272" height="222" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/paddings-and-margins-for-row-css-tab.jpg" alt="Settings for Rows: Margins and Paddings" class="wp-image-15810"/></figure></div>



<p>Each box refers to a different thing. The outermost boxes are the margins of the element, in this case, the row’s margins. The second most row, the one in the middle, is the border. Suppose you want to add a border spanning all the way across the row, you would need to input a number in each of the four second most boxes. The inner ones are padding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Underneath all of that, you can choose the style and color of the border. However, what we’re interested in, lies even further below that: the background image. If you click on the background image option, it lets you choose a photo from the media Library or upload a new one entirely. Keep in mind, if the row is stretched horizontally (using the options mentioned above) the image needs to be large enough so that it maintains its high quality.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-background-image-options">Background Image Options</h3>



<p>Background style lets you choose how the image behaves with a dropdown menu:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="123" height="87" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/background-image-repeat-on-row.jpg" alt="Background Image for Rows" class="wp-image-15811" title="td-article-img-border"/></figure></div>



<ul><li>Cover makes the image cover the entirety of the row, stretching it in various directions.</li><li>Contain shrinks or enlarges the image down to the height of the row.</li><li>No repeat places the image into the row without stretching it in any direction.</li><li>Repeat duplicates the image so that it spans all across the row.</li></ul>



<p>The background position dropdown menu affects the image placement so that it shows the middle, the bottom or even the top of it using the background style settings.</p>



<p>And the last background image option is the background opacity. If you’ve chosen an image, you can lower the image’s opacity so that it only shows a bit of it, like a silhouette.</p>



<h2 id="h-row-layout-divider">Row Layout &amp; Divider</h2>



<p>There are two more tabs when you open a row: the Divider and Layout tabs. The Divider lets you place a vector on the background of the row, creating various shapes to attract the viewer’s interest. Heaps of various geometrical forms can be achieved and maintain the contrast between different elements on the page. If you want to learn more about it, we have a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/row-divider/">Divider Tutorial<strong> </strong></a>on our blog.</p>



<p>The Layout tab covers many new features that affect the way your content is shown on the page. You can adjust the content within a column to display differently compared to the rest. Modify the order of columns for various devices, adjust the width of the row and columns, and plenty more. To explore these features, we suggest reading more about the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/flexibility-rows-columns-newspaper-theme/">Layout Options</a> on our blog.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Now that we’ve explored all the varying degrees with which you can diversify and create interesting layouts using the rows in Newspaper Theme, it’s time to put this knowledge to good use.

<p>With the new year sneaking up on us (haha, not really, let’s be honest about it, we’ve been waiting for this!), Pantone has released their Colors of the Year 2021 in a public announcement.</p>



<p>A symbolic union between two colors: the ever stable, neutral shade, <span style="background-color:#939597" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Ultimate Gray</span> and its playful, optimistic counterpart, <span style="background-color:#f5df4e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Illuminating</span>. Now, how does this impact the year 2021? Let’s answer that question by exploring the significance of the colors above and how to best implement them into your new design projects.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="660" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/monochromatic-scheme-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray.jpg" alt="monochromatic scheme illuminating and ultimate gray" class="wp-image-15750" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/monochromatic-scheme-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/monochromatic-scheme-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/monochromatic-scheme-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/monochromatic-scheme-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/monochromatic-scheme-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-696x383.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/monochromatic-scheme-illuminating-and-ultimate-gray-1068x587.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2 id="h-illuminating-ultimate-gray">Illuminating &amp; Ultimate Gray</h2>



<p>As warm as the color of the sun, <span style="background-color:#f5df4e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Illuminating</span> is a powerful yellow color that brings joy to everyone around. During the 17th century France, the Age of Enlightenment, yellow was seen as the color that shed light upon people’s ignorance. Nowadays, the color seems to be mostly associated with joy, energy, and positivity. A burst of happiness, one would say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contrast to that, <span style="background-color:#939597" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Ultimate Gray</span> is a relatively sober color, usually associated with sadness and even negativity in some cases. Gray is a dull color, but it’s always been a reliable one. As a neutral shade, it creates a perfect foundation just like how people used to make their homes out of pebbles, rocks, which were… gray! Moreover, more and more people opt for <a href="https://tagdiv.com/design-trends-minimalism-newspaper-theme/">minimalist</a> lifestyles, and for example, <span style="background-color:#939597" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Ultimate Gray</span> is a color that dominates home design and creates great contrasts between white walls, wood elements, and more.</p>



<p>This union between a stable and an optimistic color is what Pantone wants the outlook of 2021 to be. After the tumultuous year of 2020, embracing what we currently have and striving for the world’s betterment and others is an ideal, a goal, a solution. Falling in line perfectly with <a href="https://www.pantone.com/uk/en/color-of-the-year-2021">Pantone’s view of the situation</a>: “The union of an enduring <span style="background-color:#939597" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Ultimate Gray</span> with the vibrant yellow <span style="background-color:#f5df4e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Illuminating</span> expresses a message of positivity supported by fortitude. Practical and rock-solid but at the same time warming and optimistic, this is a colour combination that gives us resilience and hope. We need to feel encouraged and uplifted; this is essential to the human spirit.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-color-schemes-inspiration">Color Schemes &amp; Inspiration</h2>



<p>Whether you plan on using the hues separately or together, you need to know some color combinations. If you’re new to this, you can always check out our tutorial on <a href="https://tagdiv.com/color-theory-newspaper-theme/">Color Theory</a> to get a better understanding of the basics. First of all, let’s tackle the colors separately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For <span style="background-color:#f5df4e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Illuminating</span>, we have the analogous &amp; monochromatic schemes, which involve using different shades of yellow. Analogous uses colors that are very close neighbours to the yellow, whereas monochromatic just ups the yellow contrast. The color complementary to it is a dark shade of violet-blue. Triad relies on creating a beautiful union between Illuminating, cyan, and a deep shade of pink-purple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we approach <span style="background-color:#939597" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Ultimate Gray</span> with the same situation, we have an easier time as it is a neutral shade. It technically goes with every color. So monochromatic, analogous, triad, and complementary schemes all use different shades of gray.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keeping everything in mind about the colors themselves, you can make a beautiful combination between <span style="background-color:#f5df4e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Illuminating</span> &amp; <span style="background-color:#939597" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Ultimate Gray</span> . All you would need is some inspiration. For this, you can always use <a href="https://color.adobe.com/explore">Adobe Color</a> to explore different shades. Moreover, Pantone offered some <a href="https://www.pantone.com/uk/en/color-of-the-year-2021-palette-exploration">color schemes for the Colors of the Year 2021</a> that you can also check out. Sticking to more shades of gray and different hues of yellow is a good starting point. You could also add cyan and violet in between the yellow and gray to create a bold, enjoyable look. Let your inspiration run wild and create a unique design!</p>

<h2 id="h-design-motives-with-newspaper-theme">Design Motives with Newspaper Theme</h2>



<p>Before embarking on a new design project, please choose the color scheme you want to work with and stick with it. Whether you’re creating a new website or just modifying something you already own, you can freshen it up and reveal a whole new look. Since Newspaper Theme allows users to craft everything on the front-end, take inspiration from your favorite websites to start designing!</p>



<p>Here are a few suggestions for the people who want more than that and are waiting for examples. Change the background color to the row by going into the “CSS” tab and picking out the hex code for <span style="background-color:#f5df4e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Illuminating</span>, which is, by the way, #F5DF4D. Now change the text color for your Flex Blocks or any other items in the row to <span style="background-color:#939597" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Ultimate Gray</span>, which has the hex code #939597.</p>



<p>That’s a sure-fire way to spruce up your page! However, if you something a little bit different, you could also create highlights with <span style="background-color:#f5df4e" class="td_text_highlight_marker">Illuminating</span> on gray backgrounds. This could be applied in so many ways depending on whether you opted to use any other colors as well.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="850" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-more-somber-look.jpg" alt="A more somber look for your website" class="wp-image-15754" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-more-somber-look.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-more-somber-look-300x213.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-more-somber-look-1024x725.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-more-somber-look-768x544.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-more-somber-look-696x493.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A-more-somber-look-1068x757.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>

<p>Are you looking to start a blog to share with your friends, family, and build a supportive online community? The new Mintyside PRO demo is the perfect blend of simplicity and minimalism that is not only user-friendly but also allows you to focus on creating content. Write about interesting topics, create eye-catching titles, and let Newspaper Theme handle the full website’s design &amp; its functionality.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="843" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into.jpg" alt="Mintyside PRO demo Homepage into" class="wp-image-13933" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-300x211.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-1024x719.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-768x540.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-696x489.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Homepage-Into-1068x750.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Mintyside PRO: intro</h2>



<p>A blog can be anything from reporting on the latest trending topics (celebrities, politics, entertainment, finance, news coverage), delivering trusted information to technological and scientific developments. Even more, you can keep a daily blog as a recollection of memories, experiences, and tutorials for readers to enjoy. The Newspaper Mintyside PRO demo allows you to turn your website into the blog of your dreams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a wide-set layout, a grey background that goes perfectly with the turquoise accent colors, it embodies a feeling of freshness and energy. Combining a sans-serif font with a serif one and dividing the page into three columns, it leaves the viewers feeling like they’re reading an actual physical newspaper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By importing your featured images and content, your articles will be the center of the homepage. Monetizing your blog should also be a breeze with the Newspaper Theme’s <a href="https://tagdiv.com/ad-box-newspaper-theme/">ad box</a> and Newsletter subscription block. Award your long-time readers and entice the new ones to subscribe and send them weekly notifications about your most important blog posts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="641" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles.jpg" alt="Mintyside PRO demo Related Articles" class="wp-image-13934" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-300x160.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-1024x547.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-768x410.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-696x372.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Related-Articles-1068x570.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Breeze along</h2>



<p>Mintyside PRO demo gives you options to show off your content in different manners<a href="https://tagdiv.com/header-main-menu-newspaper-theme/">, the header main menu</a><strong> </strong>is set perfectly for not only mega menu with subcategories, simple mega menu, and even submenus. With dashed borders on hover and shadows for blocks, the demo highlights both the menu and the search bar.</p>



<p>With white rows upon a grey background, headings, excerpts, and categories, the Mintyside PRO demo makes it easier for you to build a brand and share amazing stories with the world. Each featured image can become part of a segment you want to push forward: color schemes, color theory, illustrations, photography, and more.</p>



<h2>Installing Mintyside PRO demo</h2>



<p>Version 10.3.6 of Newspaper Theme came bundled up with<a href="https://tagdiv.com/embrace-summer-with-five-new-pro-demos-newspaper-theme/"> various new demos</a>: Magazine PRO, Lifestyle PRO, Scuba PRO, Retro Blog PRO, and Mintyside PRO. Owning a copy of Newspaper Theme gives you access to all these new demos by simply updating it. If you need more information about that, there’s an in-depth tutorial on <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introduction-to-newspaper-theme-automatic-updates/">how to update your Newspaper Theme.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="652" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1.jpg" alt="Mintyside PRO demo Single Post Template" class="wp-image-13936" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-300x163.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-1024x556.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-768x417.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-696x378.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Single-Post-Template-1-1068x580.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>To install the Mintyside PRO demo, you need to access your WordPress Admin Dashboard. From there, navigate to Newspaper Theme &gt; Install Demos. Scroll down the page to find the one you’re looking for and hover over it to choose between:</p>



<ul><li>Design Only lets you import only the templates, colors, fonts, homepage.</li><li>With content comes with all the sample content: the categories and posts are included in the import.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The main difference between the two of them is the fact that once you uninstall the demo and install another one, the sample content (categories &amp; posts) are also removed from the website. If you already have content of your own, it’s best to go with “Design Only.”</p>



<h2>Header Adjustments</h2>



<p>One of the first things you should do after installing the demo is to make changes that showcase your brand and what the blog’s all about. Go to the homepage and open it through the tagDiv Composer. In the header section, click on the Logo element and upload your pre-designed logo as an image, copy and paste it as a SVG code or even create a new one with text and fonts.</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo.jpg" alt="Edit the Logo" class="wp-image-13943" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo.jpg 1890w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-300x145.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-1024x495.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-768x371.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-1536x742.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-696x336.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-the-Logo-1068x516.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1890px) 100vw, 1890px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>The next item on the agenda is the main menu. Click on it, and from the General Settings tab, choose a menu you’ve created using the WordPress widget. You can always create a new one from the Admin Dashboard &gt; Appearance &gt; Menus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scroll down the page to change the logo and menu for the sticky header, too. And last but not least, using the device bar of the tagDiv Composer, click on the mobile view and change the logo and menu for the mobile device and mobile sticky.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="642" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template.jpg" alt="Author Template Mintyside PRO" class="wp-image-13937" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-300x161.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-1024x548.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-768x411.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-696x372.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Author-Template-1068x571.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Let’s tackle the Homepage</h2>



<p>When you open the page with the tagDiv Composer you need to filter or offset Flex Blocks. To do this, click on one of them and travel to the Filter tabs. Now, sort the articles by author, categories, tags, or even by ID. From the General Tab, you can add an offset by inputting a number in the box.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the right column, you have an ad box that can show your affiliates’ ad image. Upload the photo you want to use in the Image ad tab and write the URL. Scrolling down, you have more Flex Blocks elements and a Subscription box, and to the left side of it, a Background Image set on column. The background image can be replaced by navigating to the Column &gt; CSS tab and then choosing a different image.&nbsp;</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1.jpg" alt="Edit the Subscription Box" class="wp-image-13945" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1.jpg 1797w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-300x134.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-1024x456.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-768x342.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-1536x685.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-696x310.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Subscription-Box-1-1068x476.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1797px) 100vw, 1797px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>The subscription box also needs your <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newsletter-plugin/">Mailchimp / Feedburner / MailerLite</a> code. From the General tab, choose your provider and copy-paste the embedded code in the box. Right below this, you have another ad box that you can replace with a different image and URL. The rest of the page only contains one more flex block and a Posts Loop. The Flex block can be filtered or offsetted according to what you wish to show. Save your settings!</p>



<h2>Templates</h2>



<p>The most important part of adjusting your <a href="https://tagdiv.com/what-is-the-cloud-library/">Cloud Library Templates </a>is to showcase different articles through the flex blocks used on them. And just like above, you can filter or offset them. This applies to all the templates, so just hit the “Edit Template” button and make your adjustments.</p>



<p>Moreover, on the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introducing-new-404-page-templates/">404 Template</a>, you need to add a URL that leads back to your homepage. So just copy and paste the website’s link to the button. The Author and Single Post Template have an ad box that needs to be replaced, too. Once you’re done, save your settings!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="621" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Category-Template-1.jpg" alt="Category Template" class="wp-image-13940" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Category-Template-1.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Category-Template-1-300x155.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Category-Template-1-1024x530.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Category-Template-1-768x397.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Category-Template-1-696x360.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Category-Template-1-1068x553.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Market your site’s originality</h2>



<p>If you want to change the demo’s layout, colors, fonts, you need a plan in mind. Take a look at our<strong> </strong><a href="https://tagdiv.com/typography-guide-101-basics-tips-ideas-inspiration/">typography guide </a>to understand the basics of contrast, tracking, and font-weight. Then choose fonts that are web-safe from the online gallery of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Fonts</a>. Now when you open a page or template through the tagDiv Composer, you can easily alter the fonts by going into the “Style” tab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For colors, you need a primary and an accent color to create contrast and highlight important items. To better understand color complementaries, monochromatic and analogous schemes, you should learn the basics of<strong> </strong><a href="https://tagdiv.com/color-theory-newspaper-theme/">Color Theory.</a> With a color palette in mind, replace the colors on your templates and pages using the Style tab of the elements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And last but not least, the magical tagDiv Composer allows you to make any layout alterations you need. They all can be done on the front-end by dragging and dropping items in the desired order. Create new rows, columns, adjust paddings, margins, and even borders. Once you have everything perfectly aligned, save your settings!</p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>Whether you want to modify the demo to fit your vision or not, Mintyside PRO is capable of adapting to any type of blog.

<p>Are you taking a step towards a brighter future and a better 2020? So are we! Let’s tackle the rest of the year with a positive design project. A color as enlightening and joyful as yellow is the perfect way to start your journey. Let’s dive right in by exploring some of its meanings and associations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/monochromatic-layout-design.jpg" alt="Monochromatic Color Scheme Layout" class="wp-image-13780" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/monochromatic-layout-design.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/monochromatic-layout-design-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/monochromatic-layout-design-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/monochromatic-layout-design-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/monochromatic-layout-design-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/monochromatic-layout-design-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Yellow’s Color Meanings</h2>



<p>One of the first cave drawings used yellow paste. Since then, yellow has been incorporated into art in various ways and to describe multiple things. Paintings from Medieval and Renaissance times used yellow to portray outsiders. However, that’s not the only association it has had. Artists like Vincent Van Gogh used yellow to convey light and vibrancy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the Age of Enlightenment, bright yellow was seen as light shining down on the people’s minds and bringing about a new age of prosperity, of science. So what does this color mean exactly? Yellow is often associated with joy, caution, energy, optimism, intellect, and loyalty. But let’s explore this further:</p>



<ul><li>Orange yellows are sophisticate and powerful.&nbsp;</li><li>For a somber and traditional look, brown yellows are perfect.</li><li>Refresh anything with green yellows bursting with stylishness.</li><li>Pale yellows are spring-like and pure.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/analogous-color-scheme-for-yellow.jpg" alt="Analogous Yellow Color Palette" class="wp-image-13781" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/analogous-color-scheme-for-yellow.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/analogous-color-scheme-for-yellow-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/analogous-color-scheme-for-yellow-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/analogous-color-scheme-for-yellow-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/analogous-color-scheme-for-yellow-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/analogous-color-scheme-for-yellow-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Color Schemes for Yellow</h2>



<p>Knowing the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/color-theory-newspaper-theme/">basics of color theory</a>, you might be able to guess some colors that pair well with yellow. According to the Color Wheel, here are some of yellow’s color combinations:</p>



<ul><li>Monochromatic yellow palettes use the different shades of yellow to bring consistency across the entire design. Use dark, bright, and pale hues to create contrast.&nbsp;</li><li>Analogous color schemes involving yellow rely on its neighbors: orange and green. It’s a fresh and bold way to make a statement.&nbsp;</li><li>Purple is the color complementary to yellow. With this combination, anything can be striking and exceptionally beautiful.</li><li>Split complementary relies on a triangle being drawn across the color wheel, its edges indicating this surprising, yet very alluring color combination: yellow, cyan, and red.&nbsp;</li><li>Last but not least, a triadic color palette involving yellow should contain blue and pink.</li></ul>



<p>Knowing what colors go well together can be detrimental to any design project, so choose your color palette wisely.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/complementary-yellow-and-purple.jpg" alt="Complementary Purple and Yellow Palettet" class="wp-image-13782" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/complementary-yellow-and-purple.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/complementary-yellow-and-purple-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/complementary-yellow-and-purple-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/complementary-yellow-and-purple-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/complementary-yellow-and-purple-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/complementary-yellow-and-purple-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Design with Yellow</h2>



<p>Whether you’re working in a vector-program, painting digitally or traditionally, designing a website &#8211; integrating a vibrant and energetic color as yellow should be straightforward. Create the perfect color palette that suits any motif or design idea using <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create">Adobe CC</a>. It helps you make triadic, complementary, analogous, and even monochromatic schemes. For more inspiration, there’s also a section to <a href="https://color.adobe.com/search?q=yellow">explore other schemes</a>.</p>



<p>Yellow can be the accent color of the piece you&#8217;re creating or the one which frames your composition and brings it to life, working from behind the scenes to ensure your project shines. How do you do that if you’re designing a website? With a theme that lets you edit everything on the front-end, such as Newspaper Theme, you can easily change colors for columns, backgrounds, buttons, and text.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just click on any element on the page, go to its Style settings, and choose your preferred hues. Create contrast between the text and its background to make sure it is highly visible and legible for your readers. If you’re stuck in a rut, look to your favorite websites for inspiration: how did they incorporate colors in their design? Where did they use it, and how can you do it yourself? Once you have an idea, get creative, find what works best for your vision.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/triadic-welcoming-page.jpg" alt="Triadic Yellow Color Scheme" class="wp-image-13783" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/triadic-welcoming-page.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/triadic-welcoming-page-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/triadic-welcoming-page-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/triadic-welcoming-page-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/triadic-welcoming-page-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/triadic-welcoming-page-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>Adapting is the basis of any creative endeavor. Any project undertaken shall be successful if you allow experimentation. When designing with the color yellow, keep in mind its meanings and how they can affect your general audience. What is the core message of the project, and how to convey it? Moreover, what is the driving force behind it? Use those answers to conclude what type of yellow you want to use and what color combination makes the best decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your website uses yellow throughout its design, show us its design in the comment box below. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="687" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library.jpg" alt="activate tagdiv cloud library" class="wp-image-13658" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-300x172.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-768x440.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-696x398.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-tagdiv-cloud-library-1068x611.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-tagdiv-cloud-library">How to use tagDiv Cloud Library</h2>



<p>First, make sure to activate the plugin from the theme plugins section:</p>



<p>Then go to either a category, author, tag, date, or post on your website. As long as you’re logged in, the WordPress admin bar contains a green button: Cloud Library. Click it to open the tagDiv Cloud Library and browse through the selection of predesigned templates. If you want to create your own, choose the “Blank Template” one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Click on any of them to open their “Create Template” window. Hit the button to have it imported and assigned straight onto the page you’re currently on. Great! But how do you set it globally? What if you want the current template to be on all your categories or posts? To the left of the “Cloud Library” button on your WordPress admin bar, you have your template button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you click on this tab, it opens a dropdown window with every template suitable for the page you&#8217;re editing. It should look something like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="422" height="276" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a-template-list.png" alt="a template list" class="wp-image-13654" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a-template-list.png 422w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a-template-list-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" /></figure>



<p>Any Template that you click on is applied on the current page. Please note that it does not get set globally. To assign it globally, you need to check the box next to the wanted template. Then, every page of the same type will use the template assigned by you globally.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1197px"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/How-to-Import-a-Cloud-Library-Template.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2 id="h-duplicate-rename-delete-templates">Duplicate, Rename, Delete Templates</h2>



<p>From the same dialogue box previously opened, you can delete, rename, and duplicate templates. When hovering over the title of a template, three dots appear to the right of it. Move your cursor top of the dots to get access to the following icons<img loading="lazy" width="57" height="19" class="wp-image-13641" style="width: 57px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/icons-for-templates.png" alt="icons for templates">.</p>



<p>Let’s explore each one starting from the left, moving to the right:</p>



<ul><li>The trash can icon deletes the template hovered upon. Any deleted templates can be found in the trash of your WordPress Admin Dashboard &gt; Cloud Templates &gt; Trash.</li><li>To the right of the trash icon, you have the duplicate icon. It makes a copy of the template.</li><li>When you click on the pencil icon, you can rename the template. This is perfect for organizing all templates.</li></ul>



<p>Now that the Template button has been fully explored, let’s move on to editing and creating a new template from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Delete-rename-and-duplicate-Templates-with-the-new-template-button.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2 id="h-create-templates-from-scratch">Create Templates from Scratch</h2>



<p>Before we jump into the creation process, check out the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">tagDiv Composer basics tutorial </a>to familiarize yourself with the workflow of dragging-and-dropping items to create your page’s layout. When you travel to a category, post, tag, date, search, or author page, next to the “Cloud Library” button on your WordPress Admin Bar, there is an “Edit Template” button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is only available if you have installed a demo, or imported a template already. When you click it, you get to drag and drop elements that are necessary for your audience. Keep in mind the user experience &#8211; you want every functionality to be highly visible and easily accessible. Take a look at our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/a-guide-to-avoid-web-design-mistakes/">guide to avoid design mistakes</a> and learn what the do’s and don’t’s of web design are.</p>



<p>Keep everything cohesive, restrict the number of fonts you use on the template to a maximum of three. If you need inspiration, you can also take a look at our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/seven-design-trends-for-2020/">2020 Design Trends,</a> which encompasses the year’s most popular styles. Once you’re done creating the elements, stylizing them, and choosing colors, save your settings by clicking the save icon on your tagDiv Composer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="43" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tagdiv-composer-bar.png" alt="tagdiv composer bar" class="wp-image-13642"/></figure>



<h2 id="h-let-s-sum-it-up">Let’s sum it up</h2>



<p>By exploring different templates and finding out what works best for your website, you get experience. Newspaper Theme opens up a whole new world of creation and possibilities as each choice can impact your audience. Design something stunning that makes use of excellent user experience to connect better with your viewers.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With Newspaper Theme 10.3.5 comes a whole bunch of new features for arranging your page or template’s layout. More mobility, ease of access, and faster options to move, align, and order your elements in your rows or columns. If the old school way to make advanced customizations was via the CSS box, now it’s possible to tweak those aspects by clicking some icons. Let’s learn what the new flexible rows and columns do.</p>



<h2>Layout Choices</h2>



<p>First of all, make sure you’re up-to-date with the Newspaper Theme version. If you’re new to updating your WordPress Theme, take a look at our tutorial on <a href="https://tagdiv.com/introduction-to-newspaper-theme-automatic-updates/">automatic updates</a>. Now, navigate to a page or template that you want to edit. Open the tagDiv Composer, our front-end pagebuilder. New to using the drag-and-drop editor? Discover <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">how to move and arrange elements</a> with<strong> </strong>tagDiv Composer first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Either drag-and-drop a new row into the page or just click on an already-existing one. Split the row into 2-4 different columns. Go to General and choose between the predefined column choices. You might have noticed a new tab called “Layout.” Click it to explore a whole new set of adjustments.</p>



<p>The first row contains three options:</p>



<ul><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13590" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/off-turned-on.png" alt="off-png"> &#8211; if you leave it on OFF, you deactivate the feature for the row you’re on.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13591" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/vertical-columns.png" alt="vertical columns"> &#8211; keeps the layout of the row arranged in columns vertically.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13592" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/row-columns.png" alt="row columns"> &#8211; each column gets aligned horizontally.</li></ul>



<p>Right below those, you get a checkbox to rearrange the columns in reverse order. The second option lets elements wrap inside the column, just like a text. Once you activate an option, you can see the changes happening live on the page and how your new layout looks.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Horizontal-Alignment-for-Columns.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2>Horizontal Alignment</h2>



<p>The next few settings refer to the placement of the items inside a row or column. So let’s say that you have a column with an item shorter than the total width of the column. How would you move it to the left or right side of it? You might try to add paddings or margins to the CSS settings of it. However, there’s a straightforward solution now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Click on the column you would like to modify. Now turn on the column settings ( <img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13591" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/vertical-columns.png" alt="vertical columns"> ). Right next to “Horizontal Align” are these available options:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13593" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/left-align.png" alt="left align"> &#8211; is turned ON by default and arranges all elements to the left side of the column.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="18" height="19" class="wp-image-13594" style="width: 18px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mid-align.png" alt="mid align"> &#8211; moves components to the center of the column.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13595" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/right-align.png" alt="right align"> &#8211; aligns the item on the right side of the column.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13596" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/space-evenly.png" alt="space evenly"> &#8211; works only with multiple items that are displayed on the same row and column. It distributes them to the left and right sides of the column.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13597" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dustribute-evenly.png" alt="dustribute evenly"> &#8211; just like the previous option, it only works when there are multiple elements on the same row and column. It creates an even distance between the items.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vertical-alignment-on-rows-1.mp4"></video></figure>



<h2>Vertical Alignment</h2>



<p>Do you want elements to align in the center of your row without adding unnecessary amounts of CSS? With the Vertical Alignment options, each row or column can be moved to the center, bottom, or even to the top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like with the horizontal alignment icons, there are a few icons for the vertical alignment:</p>



<ul><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13616" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/top-align.png" alt="top align">  &#8211; is turned ON by default and arranges the elements starting from the top.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="15" class="wp-image-13617" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/center-align.png" alt="center align"> &#8211; aligns the objects to the middle of the row.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13618" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bot-align.png" alt="bottom align"> &#8211; moves the items to the bottom of the row.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="10" class="wp-image-13619" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/baseline.png" alt="baseline align">  &#8211; the objects align on a horizontal line so that the text’s baseline sits on top of it.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13620" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/stretch.png" alt="stretch columns"> &#8211; this option, when turned ON on the row, makes every column equal in height to the tallest one. This is a great option to vertically align items within their columns and even to create proportionate colored backgrounds within the columns.</li></ul>



<h2>More Options, More Accessibility!</h2>



<p>The last two features for flexible rows and columns in the Layout tab are the Order and Width boxes. They allow you to control the way your content sits on the page and rearrange items differently on various devices.</p>



<h3>Order</h3>



<p>By default, it’s set on Auto, which means the columns appear one after the other exactly as you see them on the page. If you have multiple columns, at the very least 2, you can easily switch to a tablet or mobile view through the &nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="272" height="30" class="wp-image-13630" style="width: 272px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/device-bar.png" alt="device bar" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/device-bar.png 272w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/device-bar-265x30.png 265w" sizes="(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px" />&nbsp; device bar and have the columns show up in a different order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you do this? Click on the column you want to show up first and input a number. It can be any number, but for simplicity’s sake, write down 1. Now go to the second column and write down a number that’s higher than the first one; in our case, we can go from 2 to ∞. The columns should now show up with the “1” before the “2” column.</p>



<p>This is absolutely fantastic when you move to smaller devices and want your content to be the centerpiece of the website.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Width</h3>



<p>This feature works brilliantly on both the flexible rows and columns if you want to increase or decrease the amount of space they take up on the page. </p>



<p>Put in any measurement in the box, and it will increase the content accordingly. You can use pixels, percentages, points or anything as long as it is marked by the correct shortening. View a <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_measurement_units.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full list of measurements</a> here. So, if you want that column or row to increase its size, just input it in the box. </p>



<h3>Flexibility at Your Fingertips</h3>



<p>Let’s say you’ve decreased one column’s width, what happens to the rest of the columns? Most likely, they will stay at their existing width if you haven’t increased it. To make it easier, we’ve created a set of options that automatically calculate the remaining space in the row and adjust the column’s width accordingly. Let’s explore the options next to the “Occupy remaining space in row” option:</p>



<ul><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13621" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/default.png" alt="default settings"> &#8211; it is turned ON by default. It lets each column remain at the size they were when you first created the row.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13622" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/on.png" alt="turn the feature on"> &#8211; if you turn the option ON, it will adjust the column’s width to fill the rest of the row.</li><li><img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13590" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/off-turned-on.png" alt="off-png"> &#8211; turns the option OFF.</li></ul>



<p>Remember that this icon &nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="19" height="19" class="wp-image-13591" style="width: 19px;" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/vertical-columns.png" alt="vertical columns">&nbsp; needs to be turned ON on the row for this feature to work properly.</p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>As with every new feature, the best part about it is implementing it creatively on your Newspaper website. With so many options and combinations, there’s plenty to explore and discover. Moreover, there’s much to be done with the new flexible rows and columns: widening columns, stretching background colors, arranging items, and organizing your site in a simple manner!&nbsp;</p>

<p>A high-energy passionate color, red has had its fair share of symbolism throughout history. From being incorporated as a sign of power to being gifted in flower bouquets, red can include different meanings. But, how do you use it to design a website or product? Let’s explore how to best approach using this bright color in your future endeavors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/monochromatic-red-scheme.jpg" alt="Monochromatic Color Scheme for Red" class="wp-image-13553" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/monochromatic-red-scheme.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/monochromatic-red-scheme-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/monochromatic-red-scheme-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/monochromatic-red-scheme-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/monochromatic-red-scheme-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/monochromatic-red-scheme-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>The Origin and Meanings of Red</h2>



<p>It was first used as a paint dye in caves. Red as a color has always been present in nature. The flames of a fire, the petals of a flower, each are a part of this beautiful hue. However, it was during the Renaissance that red began to grow. With aristocrats dyeing their clothes scarlet, it was seen as a symbol of power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the 19th century, it took on a more significant role: a sign of revolution and anarchy. Whereas nowadays, red is seen as a feminine color. In fashion design, it is incorporated to portray sensuality and confidence. Let’s take a closer look at red’s primary meanings:</p>



<ul><li>Most traffic signs which indicate <strong>danger</strong> make use of red as a color. Whether it is high voltage markers, stop signs, or even traffic lights, the color immediately attracts attention.&nbsp;</li><li>The background or logo of an energy drink usually contains red as its primary color. Why is that? It’s because it’s a lively hue that promotes a sense of <strong>vitality</strong>.</li><li>Martyrs are usually portrayed wearing red as a color of their sacrifice and<strong> bravery</strong>. This can also be noticed on flags during wars as it inspires the troops to march into battle.</li><li>As a shade of <strong>seduction</strong>, women often wore red lipstick throughout the ages to encompass their youth.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/triadic-color-scheme-red.jpg" alt="Triadic Color Scheme for Red: an illustration website" class="wp-image-13556" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/triadic-color-scheme-red.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/triadic-color-scheme-red-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/triadic-color-scheme-red-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/triadic-color-scheme-red-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/triadic-color-scheme-red-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/triadic-color-scheme-red-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Red Color Schemes</h2>



<p>There are many variants of red: purple reds, orange-reds, true reds, and dark reds. Each one has its own personality and appeal. With orange-reds, you get a brighter and livelier shade. Purple reds tend to be more feminine, while dark reds embody a rich and luxurious vibe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When designing a product or a website, there are a few rules you must keep in mind. <a href="https://tagdiv.com/color-theory-newspaper-theme/">Color Theory</a><strong> </strong>is essential to know which colors to use together and what they create. So, these are the most popular color combinations for red:</p>



<ul><li>A<strong> Monochromatic </strong>color scheme means different shades of the same color. When adopting this type of color palette, you make use of contrast between darker and brighter tones of red.&nbsp;</li><li>Using an <strong>analogous </strong>combination of colors means using the neighboring shades of red. Pink and orange are some of the friendly neighbors to our color.</li><li>The color <strong>complementary </strong>to red is green. When paired up, they tend to symbolize Christmas and all its delights.</li><li><strong>Triadic </strong>uses neighboring colors to the complementary one for red, which are teal and yellow. This color palette has a retro-futuristic vibe.</li><li>The <strong>split-complementary</strong> for red includes a lime-green and a blue shade of green. Combined, they make a refreshing pair.</li></ul>

<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/analogous-color-scheme.jpg" alt="Letters' review - an analogous color scheme for red" class="wp-image-13552" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/analogous-color-scheme.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/analogous-color-scheme-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/analogous-color-scheme-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/analogous-color-scheme-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/analogous-color-scheme-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/analogous-color-scheme-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Designing with Red</h2>



<p>When you embark on a new project or website design, you need a plan. What is the primary purpose? This can be any number of things, such as trying to build trustworthiness or even constructing a brand image. The audience needs to receive the intended message upon first sight. Do it using color combinations that place your product’s meaning at the forefront.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While reading about the various color schemes involving red, you might have already chosen something to convey your intent adequately. Now, it’s time to decide whether to make red the primary or accent color in your design. As an accent color, it thrives on highlighting objects, whereas as a primary color, it bathes every object in it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re designing a website using WordPress, you need a template to build everything on the front-end. With Newspaper Theme, you get access to the tagDiv Composer, the frontend page builder that lets you drag and drop elements while constructing it. Let’s see how to use it to adjust your site’s colors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="900" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/complementary-red-color-scheme.jpg" alt="Complementary Color Scheme for a Fashion blog" class="wp-image-13554" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/complementary-red-color-scheme.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/complementary-red-color-scheme-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/complementary-red-color-scheme-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/complementary-red-color-scheme-768x576.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/complementary-red-color-scheme-696x522.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/complementary-red-color-scheme-1068x801.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Newspaper Theme in Red</h2>



<p>Take a look at our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">basic tutorial </a>for the front-end page builder if you’re new. Then open any page or template using tagDiv Composer. Whether you’ve installed a demo or created the entire website from the ground up, any element can be modified to fit into your chosen color palette.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Click on an object to begin editing. Go to its Style or CSS tab to adjust colors of different headings, titles, descriptions, and even image overlays for posts. As a bonus, you can add a gradient or color blending mode to any article or image. Take a look at our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/blending-modes-newspaper-theme/">helpful tutorial</a> for more information.</p>



<p>When you’ve finished creating and incorporating a red color scheme, save your settings and continue for the rest of the website to create uniformity.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>As a highly-energetic color, red can be seen as both a symbol of power and enticement. Each meaning that is associated with red, can be easily adjusted with a color combination to fit your product. While developing and creating the visual appearance of your website, you need a strong plan in mind. Furthermore, it also has to incorporate the intent behind your project. If you follow your intuition, creativity, and the plan you come up with, you’re bound for success!</p>

<p>Ready to start a blog? Become the frontrunner of a locally-brought news source or just share your insights on new technology. Show stories from all around the world with a beautiful website design. Newspaper Theme 10.3.3 released 6 new demos that are meant to stun and wow the audience. One of which is the dark yet cozy-looking PRO demo AmberLight. Let’s explore all that it has to offer and why you should consider installing it on your website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="587" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero.jpg" alt="AmberLight PRO Demo hero" class="wp-image-13479" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-300x147.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-1024x501.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-768x376.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-696x340.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-hero-1068x522.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>AmberLight: intro</h2>



<p>Emboldened by a dark background, the text and images will stand out among each page and template with AmberLight PRO. As such, your blog can deliver the content the viewers want to read in an enjoyable fashion. Combining the warm tones of yellow with turquoise and a dark green-blue, the site gets modernized while maintaining a level of comfort in aspect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bright neon turquoise tends to slip on the cyberpunk color scheme and gives the page’s elements a retro-futuristic vibe. Take advantage of this accent color as it seamlessly blends with a website focused on technological advancements. Moreover, the amber hue plays an essential role in warming up the entire layout. Contrasting widely against the cool-shades of turquoise, the golden tones are perfect for any type of blog.</p>



<h2>Taking a Dive into the Deep-End</h2>



<p>As we’ve previously seen, each <a href="https://tagdiv.com/geometric-web-design-newspaper-theme/">geometric shape has its own meaning</a>. Any element that is rounded and has no sharp edges represents harmony and safety. Consequently, AmberLight PRO demo follows that theory as each item has a curved smooth surface. Moreover, according to <a href="https://uxmovement.com/thinking/why-rounded-corners-are-easier-on-the-eyes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UX Movement</a>, while sharp corners take away focus from inside a rectangle, rounded corners place the viewer’s attention inside it.</p>



<p>Another different pair, just like the color scheme, are the shapes which appear in the design. Taking away from mathematical equations, we have polar opposites: the plus and minus sign, which are predominant throughout the demo. Of course, the last polarity of the layout is the hover effect of any feature post image, which turns black and white. By taking away the color of the photo, the feature crosses into another contrasting threshold. It marks the dissimilitude between monochromatic and colorful.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="529" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles.jpg" alt="Featured Articles AmberLight" class="wp-image-13480" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-300x132.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-1024x451.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-768x339.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-696x307.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/featured-articles-1068x471.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Installing AmberLight PRO</h2>



<p>When you update the Newspaper Theme to the latest version, you get access to all the recent features and PRO demos. Version 10.3.3 comes packed with 6 new demos, one of which is AmberLight PRO. If you’re new to WordPress, we have a helpful article on <a href="https://tagdiv.com/update-newspaper-theme/">how to update Newspaper Theme</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the Admin Dashboard, go to Newspaper Theme &gt; Install Demos. You can look for AmberLight on the side column, which shows a list of all the possible demos you can install, or scroll down the page to the featured demo image. When hovering over the demo’s photo, the <strong>Install </strong>button pops up. Moreover, right next to it, there&#8217;s a switch that allows you to import the entire demo’s articles, categories, menu items, images, and links.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your website has no content, and you want to test out how AmberLight would look, install it by letting the demo “Include Content.”&nbsp; However, if you’ve already started publishing articles and posts, flip the switch over to “Design only.” This option installs the demo without actually adding the articles and posts. Because when you uninstall a demo, it will delete all the categories and posts it came with.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Header &amp; Footer</h2>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo.jpg" alt="AmberLight PRO change the logo name" class="wp-image-13481" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo.jpg 1582w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-300x143.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-1024x487.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-768x366.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-1536x731.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-696x331.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/header-logo-1068x508.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1582px) 100vw, 1582px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>When first installing a demo, you need to make some changes to truly showcase your website. For starters, if you’re new to using the tagDiv Composer we advise you to check out the<a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/"> basic tips and tricks</a> for our frontend page builder. Now open the homepage using the tagDiv Composer and click on the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/create-a-logo-with-newspaper-theme/">Header Logo</a>. In the General Settings tab, scroll down to the “Text” section and write your website’s name inside the text and tagline boxes. Whichever word you input in the text box will be white, while the tagline will be golden. Upon hover, the colors will switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Save the settings. Go to the Admin Dashboard then to &gt; Appearance &gt; Menus. If you have already created a menu with pages, items, categories, and various other links, you can skip this step. If that&#8217;s not the case, then start dragging the homepage, and any categories you want to showcase. Make items mega menu elements or even create sub-menus. If you need more information about that, check out our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/header-main-menu-newspaper-theme/">main menu article</a>. Save the created menu, then open the tagDiv Composer on your homepage again. Click on the Main Menu item and choose your predefined menu in the drop-down list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Repeat these steps for the mobile menu by going to the Website Manager button in the top left corner of your tagDiv Composer and clicking on the mobile view. When you finish, scroll down to the bottom of the page and choose 3 different list menus for the footer. Change your Header Logo here, too, and finally: Save!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="880" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks.jpg" alt="Homepage Flex Blocks" class="wp-image-13490" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-300x220.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-1024x751.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-768x563.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-696x510.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homepage-flex-blocks-1068x783.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Homepage Adjustments</h2>



<p>If the frontend page builder is still open on the homepage, let’s take this moment to make some further adjustments. Click on the first Flex Block on the page. When importing the demo, it will display your latest posts but you can go to its Filter settings tab and choose to display a preferred category. The next Flex Block on the page can show a different category, or if you want, just add an offset so that it skips over the first few posts. Go to the General tab and add a number in the Offset Posts box. Great! Now continue filtering the rest of the Flex Blocks for the page.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the ad that appears on this page. Click on it and go to the Image Ad tab. This is where you upload an affiliate’s photo. Moreover, copy-paste the affiliate’s link in the Ad URL box. If you want to use Google Ads, go to the Custom Ad tab and input the code there. You’re done! Save the settings.</p>



<h2>Templates &amp; Contact Page</h2>



<p>The steps you’ve taken above can be applied for the rest of the templates of the website, as well. Edit them by going to the Admin Dashboard &gt; Cloud Templates and choosing which one to start &gt; Edit Template. This should open the template with tagDiv Composer using sample content. If you want a live preview of it, however, just navigate to where it’s used. For example, for single Post Templates, open an article and hit the “Edit Template” button on your admin bar.&nbsp;</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url.jpg" alt="Change the button's URL" class="wp-image-13485" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url.jpg 1600w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-300x155.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-1024x530.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-768x397.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-1536x795.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-696x360.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/404-template-url-1068x553.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>AmberLight PRO has a straightforward and direct layout design. So, all you need to do for most templates is filter Flex Blocks to display different posts and adjust codes for your Ad Boxes. The only template that needs something else done to it is the 404 Template. It contains a button that needs a link back to the homepage. Click on the button through the tagDiv Composer, and go to the General Settings tab. In the “Button URL” box type in your website’s address. Save!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="767" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page.jpg" alt="AmberLight Contact Page" class="wp-image-13494" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-300x192.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-1024x655.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-768x491.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-696x445.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/contact-page-1068x683.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Contact Page</h2>



<p>The demo also comes with its very own contact page that you can edit to your liking. Let’s go to the frontend page builder and see what needs to be edited. The first item that needs adjustment is the button: it needs a link just like the 404 Template one. Add a link to your email address using the “mailto:emailaddress” form.&nbsp;</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress.jpg" alt="Add your email address for the button" class="wp-image-13493" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress.jpg 1600w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-300x146.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-768x373.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-1536x746.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-696x338.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/email-adress-1068x519.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>Let’s check out the next element, which is a text element. All you need to do for this one is to insert your personal contact information replacing the sample one. Push the “Edit Content” button from the element’s General Settings tab. Now write your correct addresses and numbers. Great! Right below this item is a social links one. Click on it and add your precise social media usernames.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And last but not least, this element is a Flex Block. Filter it by a favorite category or add an offset to adjust what posts you want to show, and you’re done! Save.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Make AmberLight personal</h2>



<p>Just as you’ve made the last few edits to each template and page the demo has, you can make a lot more! Whether you want to adjust fonts or colors to match your website’s core vision or add new images to the contact and 404 pages, the frontend&nbsp; tagDiv Composer builder makes everything effortless and intuitive.</p>



<div><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal.jpg" class="td-modal-image"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal.jpg" alt="Make the demo yours!" class="wp-image-13497" width="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal.jpg 1600w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal-300x192.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal-1024x654.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal-768x491.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal-1536x981.jpg 1536w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal-696x445.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/make-it-personal-1068x682.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div></a></div>



<p>If you already have a color palette you want to stick to, change both the row’s background color and text colors. Links, hovers, buttons, anything can be modified. Just click on any item you want to change and go to its style or CSS tab. In fact, the newest version of the Newspaper Theme has a search bar function. Just type in “color” to see exactly what you need marked by a red dot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go through each page and template and gradually turn the demo into something stunning that wows your audience. Don’t forget to save consistently!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="651" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/author-page.jpg" alt="AmberLight Author Page" class="wp-image-13496" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/author-page.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/author-page-300x163.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/author-page-1024x556.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/author-page-768x417.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/author-page-696x378.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/author-page-1068x579.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As with every year that comes around, a new attitude begins to bloom. Influenced by a wave of social perspective, marketing, and advertising shifts to complement it. With a turmoil brewing underneath the seams internationally, Pantone chose classic blue as 2020’s color of the year. How does one color make a massive impact on design and media trends? Let’s explore its meanings and the vast possibilities of creation together.</p>



<h2>Classic Blue: Meanings</h2>



<p>When the social and cultural environment shifts and begins to change, everyone tries to cling to something that has always been constant. Just like a sunset which welcomes the cold of the night, classic blue is present in various aspects of anyone’s daily life. It can appear on the surface of any deep pool of water, the sky at night, and even in design or art.</p>



<p>To have a stable future, you need a solid foundation, and that’s where this color comes into play. With its evocative nature of peace, clarity, and even protection, the color takes precedence over any doubts or qualms anyone might have. This is precisely what is needed in such an unstable environment, such as the year of 2020. It helps with concentration and brings a sense of resilience.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="776" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Create-posters-easily-with-triadic-color-palette-classic-blue.jpg" alt="Create posters easily with triadic color palette classic blue" class="wp-image-12783" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Create-posters-easily-with-triadic-color-palette-classic-blue.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Create-posters-easily-with-triadic-color-palette-classic-blue-300x194.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Create-posters-easily-with-triadic-color-palette-classic-blue-1024x662.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Create-posters-easily-with-triadic-color-palette-classic-blue-768x497.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Create-posters-easily-with-triadic-color-palette-classic-blue-696x450.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Create-posters-easily-with-triadic-color-palette-classic-blue-1068x691.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>To Blue or not to Blue?</h2>



<p>If you’re running a company that needs a boost in its traffic, one of the best ways to achieve that is to redesign one of your projects. Trusting the front-runner of all things color-related, Pantone, is a great choice. Their decision for 2020’s color of the year comes with its own merits. Companies, marketers, and even designers have incorporated classic blue into their art, projects, and social media posts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paying close attention to other <a href="https://tagdiv.com/seven-design-trends-for-2020/">design trends that are popular right now</a> can also help you create something entirely stunning and different. And when your audience is happy with your product, they can spread the word and boost your sales and traffic.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Color Schemes</h2>



<p>Any project or product needs a plan before you start it. One of the main aspects is choosing a color palette that defines it and your own design perspective. To better understand why colors play such an essential role in creation, head on over to our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/color-theory-newspaper-theme/">Color Theory tutorial</a>.</p>



<p>One of the first things that needs to be decided is the type of color scheme you need:</p>



<ul><li>A <strong>monochromatic</strong> scheme would involve different shades of blue being used and weaved in between elements to create contrast and attract the viewer’s eye. It’s simple and direct, effective, and meaningful.</li><li><strong>Analogous</strong> is both harmonious and eloquent in getting a design started as it involves colors on the right and left side of the color you’ve chosen: purple and green shades. These hues, paired with classic blue, evoke a mysterious aura and feeling.</li><li>The <strong>color-complementary</strong> would be brown or cream. A royal or navy palette presents dark colors which are majestic in nature.</li><li>The <strong>triadic</strong> color scheme requires both lime green and red hues as the counterparts to classic blue. A rather fun color palette that can also be used to evoke a neon, futuristic style, or even a serious, somber outlook.</li></ul>



<p>If you need more inspiration, go to <a href="https://color.adobe.com/search?q=0f4c81&amp;t=hex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adobe Color</a> and explore some of the user-made color palettes that involve classic blue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Analogous-Color-Scheme-for-Classic-Blue-in-a-geometric-design.jpg" alt="Analogous Color Scheme for Classic Blue in a geometric design" class="wp-image-12782" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Analogous-Color-Scheme-for-Classic-Blue-in-a-geometric-design.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Analogous-Color-Scheme-for-Classic-Blue-in-a-geometric-design-300x150.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Analogous-Color-Scheme-for-Classic-Blue-in-a-geometric-design-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Analogous-Color-Scheme-for-Classic-Blue-in-a-geometric-design-768x384.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Analogous-Color-Scheme-for-Classic-Blue-in-a-geometric-design-696x348.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Analogous-Color-Scheme-for-Classic-Blue-in-a-geometric-design-1068x534.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h2>Designing with Classic Blue</h2>



<p>When you’ve chosen a color scheme to go with, you can begin your design process. Go into your preferred software of expertise and implement classic blue as the main color of it, and adding other shades as accent hues. This can be applied to anything you create:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>If you want to incorporate these colors in your painting, you can try forming a neon-futuristic landscape inspired by cyberpunk themes. Or even take a standard-setting and switch up colors &#8211; the grass isn’t green anymore, it’s blue, and so forth.</li><li>As an animator or 3D artist, you may need to plan out the way your project should go before you start work on it. With your plan set and knowing what you want to show, you can implement the color scheme to match it.</li><li>Illustrations and posters can be retouched by adding gradients or splashes of color that make it excitingly stunning. If you need inspiration, take a look at <a href="https://www.behance.net/search/projects/?search=classic%20blue&amp;sort=recommended&amp;time=month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Behance’s projects</a>.</li><li>When you redesign or create a new website, you have to think of the layout and the user experience before you start. The moment you have all the elements together, you can always change the color scheme to match the one you’ve chosen as your color palette.</li></ul>



<p>Keep in mind that even if you don&#8217;t find yourself targeted in this list, you can still create something unique with the chosen color scheme. Experiment, have fun, and don’t let anything constrain your creativity!</p>

<h2>Newspaper Theme &amp; Classic blue</h2>



<p>Our front-end page-builder, the tagDiv Composer, makes any design task effortless! With a few simple clicks, you can access the element’s settings and change its appearance. If you’re new to the editor, take a look at our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">first steps tutorial</a>. Let’s start with the idea behind the project: what is its purpose? Whether you’re designing a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/customize-articles-with-single-post-templates/">Single Post Template</a> or creating a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/halloween-landing-page-newspaper-theme/">Landing Page</a>, the goal is to engage your audience in a meaningful way. That can be either done by adding a subscription box, disclosing methods of contacting the company, or even by linking social media accounts that boost your follower interaction.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Layout</h3>



<p>When you have the idea, and set up a goal and start creating the layout. If you are looking for inspiration, take a look at some of the websites you enjoy browsing through. Where is their search button? How does their header look? Are the posts crowded together or given ample space between? Now that you have your inspiration, drag and drop the necessary elements into the page. Arrange them according to your vision by adding padding, margins, borders. Check out our handy tutorial about <a href="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-create-homepages-with-newspaper-theme/">creating a homepage</a> if you need further instruction.</p>

<h3>Style</h3>



<p>The next part is <a href="https://tagdiv.com/typography-guide-101-basics-tips-ideas-inspiration/">choosing fonts</a> and changing colors. To do this, click on an element to begin with and go to the “Style” tab. All the settings you need are here: text colors, backgrounds, shadows, and different borders. Change each one in a way that creates contrast. For example, if the palette chosen is a monochromatic one, you can have classic blue as the primary color of text and elements. In contrast, their background can be a pale sky blue. This can be switched up if you need for the next row to create balance and sections. The idea is to experiment with what looks good and appeals to you. Don’t forget to ask for feedback from coworkers, clients, or even the audience. A second opinion never hurts!</p>



<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>



<p>Pantone is a trendsetter in color decisions, and can positively impact your audience if you let it. Try incorporating classic blue while designing to add a touch of stability to an otherwise unstable environment. As a color of clarity and peace, let it inspire you in all of the projects you undertake.&nbsp;</p>

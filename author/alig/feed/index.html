<p>With the holidays here, we’re happy to wish that only extraordinary good things may happen to you in 2022. Yes, 2021 was another pandemic year, and we all had to face challenges. This year taught us to be kinder, to pay more attention and stay focused on the people around us and their needs. More than ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year, we all had to go the extra mile to be there for the ones that needed us. From helping your quarantined colleagues, shopping for the elders, listening to the lonely ones, to making bad jokes when things seem to go south more than usual.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re taking this moment to <strong>thank you</strong>. We are grateful for all the <strong>support</strong> you showed us throughout this year, for helping us push our limits, for <strong>keeping us strong</strong> even if you thought nothing of it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Merry-Christmas-and-Happy-new-Year-from-tagDiv.gif"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="660" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Merry-Christmas-and-Happy-new-Year-from-tagDiv.gif" alt="Merry Christmas to Everyone from tagDiv Team" class="wp-image-18760"/></a></figure>



<p>We are here<em> </em>to celebrate the end of a year, happy to share with you what these last 12 months meant to us.

<p>There are several ways to generate income. One of them is to build strong online communities. To succeed in your challenge, you shouldn’t reinvent the wheel. The already successful websites teach us that there are some available types of membership websites. Now let’s take a closer look at this matter and find the shortcut you need to succeed.</p>



<p>To create a membership website could be an easy task if you set the right triggers and keep your visitors engaged with the published content on a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-choose-a-wordpress-theme-to-design-a-membership-site/">membership platform </a>(website) that provides exclusive content for its members for a fee.</p>



<p>In this post, we want to discuss about the different types of membership websites that can drive&nbsp;new leads and monetization possibilities. Moreover, if you&#8217;ve already have a Newspaper theme license, you&#8217;d be happy to hear that in the version 11.4, <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-11-4-version/">we&#8217;ve launched the new features</a> of the tagDiv Opt-In Builder Membership Management tool, so you can lock content and sell different type of content through subscription functionality.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/exclusive-websites.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="823" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/exclusive-websites.jpg" alt="Types of Exclusive Websites" class="wp-image-18714" title="" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/exclusive-websites.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/exclusive-websites-300x206.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/exclusive-websites-1024x702.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/exclusive-websites-768x527.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/exclusive-websites-218x150.jpg 218w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/exclusive-websites-696x477.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/exclusive-websites-1068x732.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-questions-to-ask-before-you-choose-your-type-of-membership-website">Questions to Ask Before You Choose your Type of Membership Website</h2>



<p>If you are not decided yet about the type of membership website to design, you should ask yourself:</p>



<ol><li>What kind of content will you publish?</li><li>Who is your content for?</li><li>Is it a free or a paid membership website?</li><li>What are your main objectives?</li><li>Who is the target market/niche?</li><li>One time fee or recurring payment?</li><li>Do you already have credibility in the online environment?</li><li>Who is your competition?</li></ol>



<p>Write down the answers and analyze them. For sure, now you have a better idea of what exactly you want to achieve. </p>



<h2 id="h-membership-website-types-for-monetization">Membership Website Types for Monetization</h2>



<p>We have gathered some of the most popular ideas that can contribute to your plan in developing a membership site and start monetizing it.</p>



<h3>Online Courses</h3>



<p>Selling online courses is one of the most common ways to monetize your website. If you have educational certifications, you can share your knowledge with people that are ready to pay a fee to benefit from your classes. There are several ways to sell online courses; you can either hold video meetings and unlock documents.</p>



<h3>Painting, art videos, or any other hobbies</h3>



<p>Have you ever thought of getting more benefits from your hobbies rather than just your self satisfaction and way to disconnect? If you have a hobby, you can easily monetize it. The online environment is that place where you are able to show how talented you are. Moreover, you can teach others how to paint by locking your videos and including a membership tax. You’ll continue practicing and performing your hobby while you create content for your new community. The<a href="https://www.artistsnetwork.com/"> Artist Network website</a> is a membership platform where you can choose a monthly or yearly plan to benefit from videos, magazines, eBooks, and artistic workshops.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/create-membership-websites-with-newspaper-theme.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="823" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/create-membership-websites-with-newspaper-theme.jpg" alt="Create Membership Websites with Newspaper Theme" class="wp-image-18718" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/create-membership-websites-with-newspaper-theme.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/create-membership-websites-with-newspaper-theme-300x206.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/create-membership-websites-with-newspaper-theme-1024x702.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/create-membership-websites-with-newspaper-theme-768x527.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/create-membership-websites-with-newspaper-theme-218x150.jpg 218w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/create-membership-websites-with-newspaper-theme-696x477.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/create-membership-websites-with-newspaper-theme-1068x732.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<h3>Unique food recipes</h3>



<p>Millions of food blogs are already live. If your passion is cooking or baking, why not share your secret recipes with food lovers? Create and maintain a membership website and start monetizing your food challenges. People will gladly pay a fee and become the members of your group to see and try new recipes. Healthy Grocery Girl might be a source of inspiration for your <a href="https://www.healthygrocerygirl.com/">membership food website</a>.</p>



<h3>Parenting courses</h3>



<p>If you are a parent and have a solid base into parenthood, you can use your knowledge to create a website and gather&nbsp; other parents that seek for new parenting methods. As a parent, you’re facing new challenges daily. Being a member into a group that sympathises with you, a community where you can learn new tips to educate your children, might be what you’ve ever looked for. For example, the <a href="https://www.handinhandparenting.org/">Hand in Hand Parenting</a> is a membership website where you can choose your favorite payment method to be a member in the Parent Club. You can also buy courses, books, and engage with other members.</p>



<h3>Crafts for kids</h3>



<p>With these pandemic times, everything went quickly viral, and all things were moved online. And for kids, this was an extremely hard period. However, the extraordinary thing that happened was the opportunity of businesses, ONG, schools, art &amp; hobbies communities to build an online presence. Especially for parents, searching for creative resources and new ways of spending quality time with their kids. And this tendency will surely be here to stay. So, if you love kids and you’re able to create fun things and have fresh handcrafting ideas, a membership website can be an auxiliary source of income. One example would be <a href="https://thekinderartclub.com/#signup">The Kinder Art Club</a>, with two membership plans that are meant to bring out the creativity of kids.</p>



<h3>Nonprofit organizations</h3>



<p>If you want to raise money for different causes, you can build a nonprofit membership website. You can create several pricing plans for monthly or annual memberships and engage with your members through various events, programs, and valuable information. Moreover, you can have a special donation section and build a donation community base. Here’s a list of well-done NGO sites that might inspire your own <a href="https://mayecreate.com/blog/6-spectacular-non-profit-membership-organization-websites/">non-profit membership</a> website.</p>



<h3>Special Events</h3>



<p>Are you looking to showcase events from your local community such as cultural, conferences, networking, seminars, concerts, and so on? This type of membership site is based on a solid base and will bring together attendees from a broader range of places.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are so many niches you can explore, including those related to mental health and personal growth, marketing or tech. On <a href="https://www.wildapricot.com/blog/membership-website-examples">WildApricot </a>you can also discover 25 examples of beautiful membership websites, which can drive&nbsp; more ideas.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px;margin-bottom:5px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/news-website.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="660" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/news-website.jpg" alt="News Websites Examples" class="wp-image-18711" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/news-website.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/news-website-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/news-website-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/news-website-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/news-website-696x383.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/news-website-1068x587.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<h3>News Websites</h3>



<p>Similar to the way you were paying for newspapers to receive them in your physical mailbox, now you can pay for online subscriptions to read your favorite news or magazines. It’s environment-friendly, and readers can choose what type of content to read, based on your membership programs. You can head towards the Washington Post or The New York Times, as these two great examples have included the “content for members-only” policy &#8211; so people can get exclusive access to more quality news.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>A membership website is based on mutual benefits. You help others, while they help you. This type of website is beneficial for everyone. Every membership site is distinct. However, they should all contain images, video &amp; audio content, downloadable files, live streaming, a forum or social media group (connected to the site), and so on. If you have another website idea, please feel free to share it with us and our tagDiv audience.</p>

<p>The Newspaper and Newsmag themes are the <a href="https://www.wpion.com/best-premium-membership-wordpress-themes/">best WordPress themes for a membership site</a>.  They go beyond the news, newspaper, eCommerce, or blog industries. The membership functionality from the Newspaper theme introduces a new way to increase your income and the possibility of a visitor to belong to a specific community. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-membership-site">What is a Membership Site?</h2>



<p>It is a website built with member-only-access functionality. This means that some parts of the site’s content are available just for paying and subscribed members. A membership website can gain new leads for free, require a paid subscription, or can be a little bit of both.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagdiv-content-locker-opt-in-builder.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="660" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagdiv-content-locker-opt-in-builder.png" alt="Content Locker Opt-in Builder" class="wp-image-18696" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagdiv-content-locker-opt-in-builder.png 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagdiv-content-locker-opt-in-builder-300x165.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagdiv-content-locker-opt-in-builder-1024x563.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagdiv-content-locker-opt-in-builder-768x422.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagdiv-content-locker-opt-in-builder-696x383.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagdiv-content-locker-opt-in-builder-1068x587.png 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<p>Behind the paywall, subscribed members will have access to unique content, exclusive offers, or be part of a specific community. Usually, this type of functionality is given by a membership plugin or a feature built-in into the theme.</p>



<p>According to Vocabulary, you can “<a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/membership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use the noun membership</a> to describe the people who together make up a group or organization. Your secret childhood club may have had a membership consisting only of you, your brother, and your best friend.</p>



<p>Any official group has a membership, the people who belong to it. Your high school French club has a membership, and so does the United States Congress.”</p>



<h2 id="h-the-wordpress-theme-choice">The WordPress Theme Choice</h2>



<p>People build websites to provide content, show ads, sell goods, courses, and to promote their work. But how about making some income generated from your content? We all know that content is king. WordPress websites are easy to design and manage, and you can find a lot of membership themes.</p>



<p>However, if you’re concentrating on a theme specifically built for the membership industry, probably you’ll have solely that basic functionality, without the possibility of highly customizing the looks and feels of your website. If you want to attract more visitors and engage them with members-only content, you’ll need a beautiful website inside-out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To pick a WordPress theme for a membership site could be challenging. What you can do is outline your needs in terms of customizability and flexibility. Most important is that you do not need a membership theme to create a membership website, as you can use any template that is compatible with a plugin that brings such functionality.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagDiv_Blog_types-of-membership-sites_aramis-mockup.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="700" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagDiv_Blog_types-of-membership-sites_aramis-mockup.jpg" alt="Finding the perfect membership site" class="wp-image-18694" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagDiv_Blog_types-of-membership-sites_aramis-mockup.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagDiv_Blog_types-of-membership-sites_aramis-mockup-300x175.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagDiv_Blog_types-of-membership-sites_aramis-mockup-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagDiv_Blog_types-of-membership-sites_aramis-mockup-768x448.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagDiv_Blog_types-of-membership-sites_aramis-mockup-696x406.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tagDiv_Blog_types-of-membership-sites_aramis-mockup-1068x623.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>

The Newspaper theme <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covers a range of subjects</a> and industries.</p>



<p>Besides, the Newspaper theme includes the tagDiv Opt-In Builder which is a membership plugin created in-house, exclusive for our customers. It comes with more functionalities, including the possibility of placing a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-opt-in-builder-membership-management-plugin/">paid membership</a> for the site’s visitors.

<p>When you consider building a membership site, you need to have a plan. What are you trying to sell through this type of functionality, which audience do you aim to reach out to? You’re actually trying to gather more people interested in the same activity.</p>

<h4>Standalone: Update tagDiv Opt-In Builder individually</h4>



<p>As we plan to continue developing the paywall and membership capabilities, we’re making tagDiv Opt-In Builder the first tagdiv plugin that can be updated without the theme. It works as a standalone plugin that will be updated even if the Newspaper theme is not.</p>



<h2>Pop-up Shortcode for Dragging Attention</h2>



<p>We know pop-up windows can be annoying sometimes, however they are a useful marketing tool. The Newspaper theme comes with the capability to create awesome pop-ups without installing new, paid plugins. The Modal Popup element gives you the power to control all the functionality. The shortcode helps you to highlight an important piece of information or content. With a modal popup, you can create:</p>



<ul><li>Pop-up ads</li><li>Fly-out menus</li><li>Sale campaigns and discounts</li><li>Free downloads (ebooks, software, videos &amp; more)</li><li>Warnings and alerts</li><li>Several Form Types (newsletter, login, or signup)</li><li>Multi-step processes to complete wizards or install something</li><li>Announcements and events</li><li>Online courses and services</li><li>And many more.</li></ul>



<p>For the user experience, the <strong>Modal Popup shortcode</strong> is a beautiful way to interact with your website and it is also a<strong> valuable marketing asset</strong> for you. The Modal Popup shortcode appears on the site until the user clicks on the “<strong>x</strong>” button. You can set it to reappear after several hours or when the page is refreshed. Moreover, this type of pop window can appear while scrolling, and content locks instantly. To unlock it, the audience should <strong>subscribe to become members</strong>. Give it a try and see how it works for you!</p>

<p>What’s a site footer? Is it the boring area situated at the bottom of every web page on a site? You should think of it as the blog index, the area that contains the most important information helping and guiding users on finding your awesome content. Newspaper includes a one-of-a-kind <strong>footer builder and tagDiv cloud footer templates </strong>that can help you stand out from the crowd with a unique website style and feel. Depending on the type of website you’re building or redesigning, the footer goals may differ.</p>



<p>In daily life, we have patterns. So it is with websites. It’s an eye pattern. When we scroll down to see the footer of a site, we’re looking out for the subscription box, contact details, phone number, or the blog link.</p>



<p>There are several elements that make this a must section and an informative area.&nbsp;Let&#8217;s discover the best practices for website footer and explore them together in this article.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-a-footer-builder">What’s a Footer Builder?</h2>



<p>A footer builder is a helpful tool that allows you to modify the sites’ footer by using elements you can customize. In the Newspaper theme, the footer builder is integrated with the Website Manager tool, part of the live tagDiv Composer page builder. You can use the drag and drop functionality and the available right-click settings, such as delete, duplicate, copy or paste.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Footer-Website-Manager.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="660" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Footer-Website-Manager.jpg" alt="Footer Website Manager" class="wp-image-18147" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Footer-Website-Manager.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Footer-Website-Manager-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Footer-Website-Manager-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Footer-Website-Manager-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Footer-Website-Manager-696x383.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Footer-Website-Manager-1068x587.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<p>The footer section is highly customizable by using the live tool. Furthermore, you can select a pre-designed template from the tagDiv Cloud Library and adjust the element’s settings. Or, you can always design one from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-explore-the-footer-designs-from-the-tagdiv-cloud-library">Explore the Footer Designs from the tagDiv Cloud Library</h2>



<p>Why is it important to invest time into designing sleek footers on your site? Because it is another place to keep visitors interested.

This section is also vital for your website’s guidance due to clear navigation tools.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-footer-design-trends">Footer Design Trends&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Similar to the header design trends, the <strong>footer trends</strong> have something consistent. They must be straightforward and aesthetically appealing. Keep this area as smooth as possible to deliver professionalism.</p>



<p>1.<strong>Color Schemes</strong></p>



<p>Your footer colors should be picked to meet the brand strategy. Use the color schemes that best describe your website orientation.</p>



<p>2. <strong>Background Image&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>It says that an image is worth a thousand words. You can choose to place a <strong>fixed image background</strong> in the footer area to express your site’s personality. Depending on the displayed elements, rows, and columns, you can show a colored image or a dark one.</p>

<p>4. <strong>Custom footer templates</strong></p>

<p>5. <strong>Dark Footers</strong></p>



<p>Dark footers are edgy, elegant, simple, and use light typography to highlight contrast. The elements present on dark footers are always more visible when a variation of colors and font sizes, as well as visual graphics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>6. <strong>Light</strong></p>



<p>A light footer means an area that uses a white or a bright background with elements organized in a logical way. This type of footer is present on media or local newspaper websites.</p>

<p>With Newspaper and it’s powerful <strong>header builder and tagDiv Cloud Header templates </strong>your websites can be outstanding right from the top. You can think of <strong>headers </strong>as the main entrance of your website. Once the door is opened, you’re entering a fascinating world. A universe of thoughts and stories. Bright, vibrant colors, with patterns or textures, solid colors or gradients &#8211; the header areas have to look amazing right out of the box.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <strong>web design</strong>, the header must be intuitive and straightforward. How’s your website header? Are you looking for inspiration to make it stand out? Look no further than the <strong>Newspaper </strong>Header Builder and tagDiv Cloud Templates. With the tagDiv premium theme you have the power and freedom to build astonishing headers designs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-a-header-builder">What’s a Header Builder?</h2>



<p>It’s a tool that lets you customize the website’s header, including menus and top areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <strong>Newspaper theme</strong>, this is a functionality that allows you to <strong>drag and drop</strong> elements to configure the <strong>above the fold area</strong> of your website. It’s an integrated part of our frontend tagDiv Composer <strong>page builder</strong> and can be found within the <strong>Website Manager tool</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/website-manager-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="660" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/website-manager-1.jpg" alt="Website Manager Button and Settings - Header Builder" class="wp-image-17922" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/website-manager-1.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/website-manager-1-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/website-manager-1-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/website-manager-1-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/website-manager-1-696x383.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/website-manager-1-1068x587.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<p>The header section can be customized using the live editing. Moreover, you can choose a pre-designed template from the tagDiv Cloud Library and modify it. Or, you can build one from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-explore-the-header-designs-from-the-tagdiv-cloud-library">Explore the Header Designs from the tagDiv Cloud Library</h2>



<p>Exclusively for the Newspaper theme, we’ve built a gallery that comes with already-created designs that can be used on any page or posts. There are over 100 header pre-designed templates within the <strong>tagDiv Cloud Library</strong>. Dark, light, colored or with neutral shades, you can mix and match elements to build your own personalized header.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://cloud.tagdiv.com/#/load/Headers">preview all the headers</a> from the Cloud Library and also, another recommendation is to browse the <a href="https://demo.tagdiv.com/select_demo/select_demo_newspaper/?">pre-built websites samples</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-build-the-perfect-header-with-newspaper-and-tagdiv-cloud-templates">How to Build the Perfect Header with Newspaper and tagDiv Cloud Templates&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you’re already familiar with the tagDiv Composer page builder and the tagDiv Cloud Library, you&#8217;re one header away. The <strong>easy-customization </strong>made right on the frontend of your site makes the entire process a piece of cake. For more <strong>step-by-step guidance</strong>, you can follow our <a href="https://forum.tagdiv.com/header-manager/"><strong>header documentation</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px;margin-bottom:0px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cloud-templates-header-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="640" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cloud-templates-header-1.jpg" alt="tagDiv Cloud Library - Header Templates" class="wp-image-17920" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cloud-templates-header-1.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cloud-templates-header-1-300x160.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cloud-templates-header-1-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cloud-templates-header-1-768x410.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cloud-templates-header-1-696x371.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cloud-templates-header-1-1068x570.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<p>With Newspaper theme, possibilities are endless. But how about the performance of your site? Did you know that a large image or video placed in the header can slow down your overall site speed? Below you’ll find some quick tips in creating the perfect header and what you must include:</p>



<ol><li>Avoid using huge <strong>banners </strong>above or below the header section. </li><li>Make sure your header looks smooth on mobile to keep bounce rate as low as possible.</li><li>Limit your <strong>color </strong>palette. Rainbows are great, but not if you’re a business.</li><li>Keep your logo visible. It’s your <strong>brand identity </strong>and can make a strong impression.</li><li>You can drive <strong>emotions </strong>with the header section. Spark your reader’s curiosity and trust. </li></ol>



<p>Elements to include on your header section:</p>



<ul><li>Include a <strong>call to action button</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Contact Information or an <strong>About </strong>section.&nbsp;</li><li>Shopping cart &#8211; if you own an <strong>eCommerce </strong>store.</li><li>Share your <strong>social network</strong> profiles.</li><li>Place a search <strong>icon</strong>, box, or field.</li><li>Multi-language switcher (if needed)</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-header-design-trends-come-and-go">Header Design Trends come and go</h3>



<p>Yes, you can make your header a perfect one. If you like it and it’s <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/website-navigation/">easy-to-navigate</a> for your visitors, you’ll see great traffic results. Indeed, headers are the main navigation source on your site, but sidebars and footers are also important guidance tools. These areas must be highlighted somehow. One of the long-lasting trends is the sticky header &#8211; that is present while you scroll down the page.</p>



<p>If you don’t have discovered your own style yet, with Newspaper and the already available, as well as newcomer header designs, you can get your inspiration in an instant. Now, let’s take a look at other design trends that can help you get the best out of your site.</p>

<h4 id="h-dark-themed-headers">Dark-themed headers</h4>



<p>Some people prefer to display the menu on a dark background. Perhaps, due to the contrast between a dark space and white/grey typography. This way, all the elements present on the header section will be automatically highlighted.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-light-themed">Light-themed</h4>



<p>A light header is always appealing and appropriate for any kind of website. If you’re all into the airy headers, you can keep elements at a minimum and the background transparent.</p>



<h4 id="h-image-background">Image Background</h4>



<p>Since Google has renewed the pagespeed factors for ranking your site higher in SERP, keeping the header section without an image might be a bonus. However, some people prefer using a well-optimized image background and keep the menu simple.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="h-hamburger-menu">Hamburger menu</h4>



<p>For an enhanced user experience, the <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/pros-and-cons-of-hamburger-menus/">hamburger menu eases navigation</a> on a website. It’s a minimal and elegant icon and is recognisable on any device.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-subscription">Subscription&nbsp;</h4>



<p>If you’re all into email marketing, you can place a subscription element into the header section. This is an excellent way to engage with your visitors after they leave your website.</p>



<h4 id="h-banners">Banners</h4>



<p>A <a href="https://vtldesign.com/web-strategy/homepage-banner/">banner placed in the header</a> of your website will always get noticed. Especially on a news website, where you have many useful things to highlight.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creative-header-template-v2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="563" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creative-header-template-v2-1024x563.jpg" alt="" data-id="17950" data-full-url="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creative-header-template-v2.jpg" data-link="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-use-the-header-builder-and-tagdiv-cloud-header-templates/creative-header-template-v2/" class="wp-image-17950" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creative-header-template-v2-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creative-header-template-v2-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creative-header-template-v2-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creative-header-template-v2-696x383.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creative-header-template-v2-1068x587.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creative-header-template-v2.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">Creative Header Template</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gradient-header-templates.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="660" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gradient-header-templates.jpg" alt="" data-id="17945" data-full-url="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gradient-header-templates.jpg" data-link="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-use-the-header-builder-and-tagdiv-cloud-header-templates/gradient-header-templates/" class="wp-image-17945" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gradient-header-templates.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gradient-header-templates-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gradient-header-templates-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gradient-header-templates-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gradient-header-templates-696x383.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gradient-header-templates-1068x587.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">Gradient Header Template</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>



<h4 id="h-creative">Creative</h4>



<p>This creative header example is a black and white combo with red shades. In the left side there’s the logo in bold fonts and a minimal banner with a CTA button is placed in the middle. Everything you need is already there: weather stats, date, search area, latest article thumbnail, menu, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-gradients">Gradients</h4>



<p>If you want to <a href="https://cssgradient.io/">expand the color scheme </a>on your site and go beyond the natural shades, gradients are all you need. It’s a unique approach and can streamline your website and implicit your brand’s identity.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-make-your-header-design-astonishing-with-newspaper-theme">Make Your Header Design Astonishing with Newspaper Theme</h2>



<p>How many headers are enough? There’s no limit. You can customize an infinite number of header sections and divide your website categories as you want. The header area is that essential part of your website. Keep it simple, keep it clean but stylish. With <strong>Newspaper theme and tagDiv Cloud Header Templates</strong>, each page of your site can have a different header section to help you convert your readers into customers.</p>

<p>Wondering to hire a <strong>Freelancer</strong> vs. <strong>Software Development Company</strong> to help you with your website? There’s a reason why you’re bouncing between the idea of choosing an entire team to coordinate your new website or app development over a freelancer. Do you need a larger perspective vs. a narrow one?&nbsp;</p>



<p>A software company can <a href="https://tagdiv.com/services/web-development-wordpress-services/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=td_shop&amp;utm_content=freesoft">identify exactly the client’s needs</a>, as it has a broader perspective over a project; a team will always come up with more ideas and can deliver a large number of tasks simultaneously.</p>



<p id="freelancevssoftware1">Now, let’s see the <strong>differences between a software development company and a freelancer</strong>, besides the most obvious: a team vs one member.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-helping-businesses-to-achieve-their-goals">Helping Businesses to Achieve their Goals</h2>



<p id="freelancevssoftware2">The purpose of either a software development company or a freelancer is to <strong>help businesses</strong> (or individuals) achieve their goals and get the most out of their websites/web solutions. Now, the difference between a freelancer and an entire software development company is quite straightforward. A team vs. a member. Employees that have expertise in several specializations or someone specialized in a particular field.</p>



<h2>Software Development Company</h2>



<p>A software development team can <a href="https://tagdiv.com/services/web-development-wordpress-services/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=td_shop&amp;utm_content=freesoft">build from the ground up an entire website</a>, mobile development, app development, web design solutions, or implement whatever you have in mind in tech terms. There are also many companies around the world, each with its own strengths and pain points. The projects handled by such businesses are service-based or item-based.</p>



<p>When a software development company starts working on a project, there’s an entire process. Here’s a quick overview:</p>



<ol><li>The team analyzes your requirements.</li><li>Technically structure the project and outline the design ideas.</li><li>Recommends solutions and best courses of action to help you reach your goals.</li><li>Establish the project path, document, and timeline of the project.</li><li>Develop the solutions.</li><li>Test and adjust the solutions (including fixing bugs).</li><li>Deploy the solution.</li><li>Project maintenance. The team continues the development of complex solutions.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/company-software-development.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="660" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/company-software-development.jpg" alt="Software Company Offices" class="wp-image-17786" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/company-software-development.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/company-software-development-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/company-software-development-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/company-software-development-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/company-software-development-696x383.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/company-software-development-1068x587.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<h3 id="freelancevssoftware3">Departments</h3>



<p>Before going in-depth, you should know that in a software company, there is usually more than one department that helps the project transition :</p>



<ul><li><strong>Web development</strong> &#8211; a team of backend programmers that connects the coding lines and builds strong algorithms.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Web design</strong> &#8211; a team of experienced frontend web designers entitled to create exquisite user interfaces that combine best user experience practices with amazing visuals.</li><li><strong>Project management </strong>&#8211; designated team to manage a whole project. Usually, there’s a project manager that is in charge of coordinating the flow. Moreover, there can also be a product owner, team lead, technical lead, release manager, and so on.</li><li><strong>QA/Testing</strong></li><li><strong>Legal </strong>&#8211; department responsible for creating agreements&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Marketing and PR</strong></li><li><strong>HR and administrative&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p id="freelancevssoftware4">Usually, for a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/professional-software-company-web-development-and-web-design-custom-solutions/">web development project</a> you need a team of developers and a project manager to coordinate the entire process. However, there are times when the web design team needs to step in. Or, perhaps, you need some SEO or marketing valuable advice customized for your site. This means you work closely with highly specialized people with different expertise in the same team.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Benefits</h3>



<p>When you hire an entire software development company, you get more benefits. You do not have to outsource your project to another different company or hire ten freelancers to do different things for you. Instead, you have an entire company divided into professional and skilled teams that can make things happen on your site. Agreements, invoices, everything is handled between the companies. Moreover:</p>



<ul><li>The <strong>time frame</strong> is more likely to be respected &#8211; the company can always bring more software engineers to work on a project.</li><li><strong>Expertise </strong>&#8211; high level for providing professional services</li><li><strong>Well-organized</strong> and predictable <strong>project workflow</strong>.</li><li>Documentation, support, and maintenance.&nbsp;</li><li>You have skilled and <strong>well-trained team members</strong> for each of the tasks instead of a one-man show.</li><li>Seamless <strong>communication </strong>and project management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p id="freelancevssoftware5">You can search for a software development company on Google, and you can also see if it’s listed on the business platforms (Clutch, for example) that inspire trust.</p>



<h3>How much does it cost to hire a software development company?</h3>



<p>Each <a href="https://tagdiv.com/submit-a-request/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=td_shop&amp;utm_content=freesoft">software development company</a> has its own pricing, and this depends on how complex the project is and the needed technology. The <strong>most often pricing mode</strong>l is per hour. However, some payments can be made per the whole project, trimester, annually, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Software development companies are of many types. Work with the one that can <strong>provide solutions based on your specific demands.</strong> However, if you do not have a WordPress development team in-house, you can always outsource your project. This means there’s a win-win situation for both companies and the client.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" style="max-width:none;width:1200px"><a href="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/freelancing-developers-at-home.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="660" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/freelancing-developers-at-home.jpg" alt="Freelancing Developer Remote Work" class="wp-image-17788" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/freelancing-developers-at-home.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/freelancing-developers-at-home-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/freelancing-developers-at-home-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/freelancing-developers-at-home-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/freelancing-developers-at-home-696x383.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/freelancing-developers-at-home-1068x587.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure>



<h2 id="freelancevssoftware6">What’s a Freelancer?</h2>



<p id="freelancevssoftware7">A person that works on his own, without being employed at a company. As described by the Cambridge dictionary and highlighted on Investopedia, “a freelancer is an individual who <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freelancer.asp">earns money on a per-job</a> or per-task basis, usually for short-term work. A freelancer is not an employee of a firm and may therefore be at liberty to complete different jobs concurrently by various individuals or firms unless contractually committed to work exclusively until a particular project is completed.”</p>



<h3>Necessary skills</h3>



<p>A freelancer might be a skilled person who has previously worked in a company and decided to go <strong>independently</strong>. Or, it could be someone who has never previously worked in a multi-level institution. However, being a freelancer means working on several projects at the same time. In this job, <strong>time-planning</strong> is the key. If time management is lacking and everything is done on the run, the projects might not be professionally performed or delivered in time.</p>



<p id="freelancevssoftware8">On the other hand, there are <strong>expert developers who work as freelancers</strong> and know how to handle their time and the project. So, depending on the type of business you have and the job complexity, you should hire a software development company or a freelancer.</p>



<h3>How much does it cost to hire a freelance developer?</h3>



<p id="freelancevssoftware9">Sometimes, the fees of a freelancer are much lower than a company. However, you should bear in mind that there are also income taxes that need to be paid as a freelancer, as well. A freelancer is self-employed so he needs to invest in an office, equipment, certifications, and others. Also, if he’s <a href="https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/211062538-Freelancer-Service-Fees">listed on a freelancing platform</a>, for example, Upwork charges 20% off from the first $500 project. On Upwork, you can find Java developers starting from $40 an hour to over $100/hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Benefits</h3>



<ul id="freelancevssoftware10"><li>Work from home or from everywhere</li><li><strong>Flexible </strong>work schedule</li><li><strong>Low </strong>cost</li><li><strong>Time flexibility</strong> &#8211; they might work more than 8 hours per day to deliver a project</li><li>Best for small and granular projects (or tasks)</li></ul>



<h3>Freelancing Disadvantages&nbsp;</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Income uncertainty </strong>&#8211; this can destabilize the collaboration between you two.</li><li><strong>Job stability </strong>&#8211; sometimes there’s an ongoing project and two in standby, or none.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Unreliability </strong>&#8211; there are freelancers that leave without delivering the final project. Motives are usually circled around the desire to take on too many projects at once.&nbsp;</li><li>A freelancer is specialized either in development, design, marketing, or other. Development also means JavaScript, Python, and other coding languages. One developer that knows JavaScript might not be an expert in another programming platform.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Please note that there are also experienced and appreciated freelancers that work hard and deliver amazing projects. However, it might be difficult to find them and build a trusting business relationship. If you still want to hire a freelancer, you should definitely consider checking out the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-freelance-websites">best freelance websites</a>. These can help you make a decision.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="freelancevssoftware11">Freelancer vs. Software Development Company: Developers</h2>



<h4>Software development company PROS:</h4>



<ul><li><strong>Guarantee </strong>&#8211; you will always receive the work you’ve been paying for&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Long-term</strong> collaboration&nbsp;</li><li>Continuous maintenance and support</li><li>Real project <strong>estimation </strong>&#8211; for the given requirements, you receive a project estimation</li><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong></li><li>Suited for <strong>all types of projects</strong></li><li>Dedicated team</li></ul>



<h4>Freelance developers PROS:</h4>



<ul><li><strong>Lower </strong>costs &#8211; could be more affordable if you have a lower budget</li><li><strong>Small</strong>-projects, granular tasks</li><li><strong>Flexible </strong>working hours&nbsp;</li><li>Faster development when projects are clear and there’s no unknown to meet.</li></ul>



<h4>Software development company CONS:</h4>



<ol><li><strong>Higher pricing</strong> &#8211; this is directly proportional to the quality of work&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Flexibility </strong>&#8211; is less flexible, as usually, developers work on a fixed 8 business hours schedule.</li><li><strong>Starting the project</strong> &#8211; could be a bit overwhelming, as there are several things to perfect and assemble before starting the project.</li></ol>



<h4>Freelance developers CONS:</h4>



<ul id="freelancevssoftware12"><li>Might <strong>not be able to</strong> provide continuous maintenance and support</li><li>Could appear <strong>expenses </strong>that are not <strong>predicted</strong>.</li><li><strong>Short-term</strong> collaboration.</li><li><strong>Lack of project-focus</strong> &#8211; they could switch between jobs.&nbsp;</li><li>Suited for a <strong>specific type of project</strong>.</li></ul>



<h2>Hiring someone for short term or long-term?</h2>



<p>Depending. What kind of job do you need? It’s a one-time project, or do you need maintenance and support after its completion? Make a <strong>list with all the specifications </strong>and your <strong>budget</strong>. Research similar projects and ask both freelancers and software companies for a budget, workflow, and timeframe estimation. So, its between freelancer vs. software development agency.</p>



<p>Finding the right person or team could be challenging, but since you’re investing in getting the most out of your business, <strong>you deserve the best solutions </strong>and providers. Whether it’s a freelancer, a software development company, or a <a href="https://www.topdevelopers.co/directory/digital-marketing-service-providers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">digital marketing agency</a>, each has its own strengths.  </p>



<p id="freelancevssoftware13">While easy tasks will take less time, complex projects need longer time. For example, if you have a website and want to redesign 5 pages, this will be completed quickly. Bur, on the other hand, if you need to <strong>redesign </strong>the whole website (various pages, thousands of posts, images, and so on) &#8211; this requires more time, creative effort, and hard work.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Still in Dilemma?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If anything sounds risky to you, you shouldn’t proceed with it, even if it’s cheaper. It will definitely get expensive if someone else has to work again on the same project. Choosing a freelancer vs. software company development might be overwhelming.</p>



<p>Understand the benefits, the pain points, the expertise, and finally &#8211; work with those that connect with you best. Creating a seamless business relationship built on transparency and trust are the utmost important things. You can have this with both software development companies and freelance developers. <strong>It’s basically a triangle of worth: project, time, and money. </strong>Start with yourself and the project needs before making a decision.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>eCommerce has its roots in the ‘70s. However, the first secure online payment was made in 1994 when someone bought a Sting music CD from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetMarket" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NetMarket</a>. Amazon was launched by Jeff Bezos in 1995, the Alibaba Group appeared in 1999, and eBay in 2001. Alright, these are historical facts that can be easily found on Wikipedia and other related websites. But, how about things that are not so easy to find?</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll tell you something about human behavior, marketing insights, and the eCommerce industry in general. Regardless of the reason you’re here &#8211; launching an online store or just for extra information, note that the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/understanding-the-ecommerce-business-in-2021/">eCommerce industry </a>is a jungle, and the jungle is real life. Things don’t come for granted, and you’ll have to work your way around.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-do-people-buy-products-or-new-items-what-drives-people-into-buying-new-things">Why Do People Buy Products or New Items? What Drives People into Buying New things?</h2>



<p>We admire everything that looks nice and feels good. We love textures, flavors, colors, and new beginnings. There’s always a motive for buying any product, starting with basic needs such as groceries, cleaning supplies or apparel items. Besides necessity, there are other motives, most of them driven by <strong>emotions and impulses</strong>.</p>



<p>Nowadays, we are all digital enthusiasts and online stores have attractive websites and intuitive mobile applications. We are happy when something we desire is cheaper. Sometimes, we only buy the item because it’s cheap, not because we really need it. </p>



<p>When <strong>we make a purchase</strong>, we’re actually behaving in a specific way. “Maslow&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hierarchy of needs</a> is used to study how humans intrinsically partake in behavioral motivation,” notes Wikipedia. For a full analysis on <strong>Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of needs</strong>, you can refer to the <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-4136760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Very Well Mind</a> website.</p>



<h2>Did You Know That:</h2>



<ol><li>The first online shopper was an old lady who bought groceries through television.</li><li>The first secure payment and online selling was in 1994.</li><li>Top three countries with the <a href="https://www.ecommerce-nation.com/the-top-10-e-commerce-markets-you-should-target-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest eCommerce sales</a> are: China, USA, and the UK.</li><li>We can think of online shopping as defined by Maslow&#8217;s in the hierarchy of needs</li></ol>

<p></p>



<h2>How Emotions Push Decisions and Drive More Sales</h2>



<p>The shopping behaviour is strongly engaged by emotional moods. If you’re looking out for new ways to drive more sales to your shop, you must know that decisions are not rational. You can really influence people into buying your products. </p>



<p>When we are about to make a choice, if something similar happened to us in another context, we will tend to take the decision based on the feeling we had back then: either positive or negative. “The decisions we make are influenced by the context in which they take place, and our perceptions of their outcomes are also seen through the same lens,” notes <a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/brain-decision-making-16971/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neuroscience News</a>.</p>



<p>Another great and comprehensive article with real examples is the one conducted by the Invesp team, that explains <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/use-emotional-triggers-to-boost-ecommerce-sales-with-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how emotional triggers can boost eCommerce</a> industry and sales.</p>



<h2>Future is bright. Future is eCommerce only!</h2>



<p>People tend to buy everything online. They seek painless payment methods, they love <a href="https://www.linnworks.com/blog/ecommerce-trends-survey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">omnichannel shopping</a> experience, fast-delivery is a must, and convenience is top. Less fill-out forms, the opportunity to buy directly without creating an account and validate it through email, flexible payment choices &#8211; all these are consumer behavior facts.

<p>The eCommerce industry is expanding rapidly.

<h2>Consumer Behavior has changed and it is here to stay</h2>



<p>Deloitte has conducted a study and speculated that in the future “<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/retail-distribution/retail-and-consumer-products-predictions.html">digital devices would replace store clerks</a>, enabling customers to try out products virtually, and algorithms would make personalized recommendations based on purchase history.”</p>



<p>Consumers have found new ways of spending their free time instead of cooking or doing shopping physically. This type of consumer behaviour will not revert to the one before it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, according to <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/townsquare/how-to-start-an-online-store">SquareUp</a>, “customers have embraced online shopping, spending $861.12 billion online with U.S. retailers in 2020, up 44% from 2019.”</p>

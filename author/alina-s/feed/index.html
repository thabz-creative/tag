										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To all customers, media, partners, friends, and critics. We would like to record our position about the Key Activation Issue. Our stand is: we have got this wrong and we are deeply sorry.</p>
<p>When we implemented the DRM in the Newspaper theme, we tried to provide you with a more secure website environment. We express our most profound and humble apologies.</p>
<p>From the utmost care for our customers, accidentally, we&#8217;ve created an incident that affected a few dozens of our users&#8217; websites. We&#8217;ve implemented this automated system that validates the product key in the Envato API as a measure to prevent piracy.</p>
<p>This piracy affects the quality of care we can provide for you, and the website owners with their websites exposed by nulled versions. We gladly respond to all our users&#8217; concerns and assist you. For us, our customers&#8217; needs play the most crucial role in our company&#8217;s values.</p>
<p>The number of requests sent by the automated system quickly hit the Request Rate Limit of the Envato API. In the absence of a positive validation response, the system blocked the website. We know that no technical explanations can ease the frustration, as we feel the same way. We understand that you&#8217;ve worked hard for your project just like we have for ours, and this should not have happened.</p>
<p>This was a big mistake on our part, and we&#8217;re sorry for it. Apologizing isn&#8217;t enough. We have been working for the last days to make sure your website will never be locked again. We will thoroughly investigate how this happened to prevent this type of mistake from happening again.</p>
<p>We take it extremely seriously as we understand the disruption caused in your services. We have taken down the DRM automated system, deleted the image, and <strong>released an updated version &#8211; Newspaper 11.3.2. &#8211; to fix and prevent this issue in the future</strong>. The update is already available for you.</p>
<p>We agree with all the criticism that this has generated – we have got this wrong, and we agree that, even if unintentional, this incident should not have happened. We appreciate the support of those who have seen that the implementation was not intended to cause offense or harm.</p>
<p>Our support team is available on all support channels to help you overcome this incident. You can reach us via email at <strong>contact@tagdiv.com</strong>, or with a new thread on <strong>forum.tagdiv.com</strong>.</p>
<p>tagDiv is truly committed to providing a trustworthy, safe, and easy-to-use environment for the website owners in this effervescent and dynamic online environment. Our primary focus has always been you, our customers. We&#8217;ve created solutions for connecting people with technology, solutions for the people to create and manage their websites easily, always placing people and their needs before everything, even our product.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll continue to create useful features that help you succeed with your website project. Now, more than ever, this incident taught us the need to be more than careful with our releases, and be there for you when you need us. We&#8217;ll keep this promise to you.</p>
<p>Please accept our apologies!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We are thrilled to announce that Clutch has designated tagDiv as the top B2B company in Romania and leader for Eastern European countries in web development and web design services for 2020. What does it mean? It means that all the feedback our customers provided on the American review platform consolidates tagDiv Web development as a trustworthy B2B partner for international companies. Furthermore, Clutch has released the <a href="https://clutch.co/press-releases/announces-top-performing-b2b-companies-web-development-space-2021?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Top-Performing B2B Companies in the Web Development Space for 2021 </a>and tagDiv is one of the leading WordPress firms worldwide in early 2021. </p>



<p>At the end of 2019, we&#8217;ve decided to expand tagDiv business lines to provide on-demand web development and web design services for website owners around the world. To help us cross the bridge faster, we needed to make sure that companies searching for the services we can provide can find us. Clutch is a partner that supports our efforts.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-clutch-co">What is Clutch.co?</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="150" height="150" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/icon1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13897"/></figure></div>



<p>You know what the Yellow Pages refer to? If you do not know, then it&#8217;s time to acknowledge: it&#8217;s the old telephone book people used to have in their houses. Yeah, in that time when mobile phone numbers were not available at a one-tap Google search result. So, just like the old Yellow Pages book, Clutch is a huge directory that contains information about the best business companies around the world, from several industries including advertising, marketing, SEO, mobile app development, web &amp; software development, web design, and IT services &amp; solutions.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="150" height="150" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/icon2.png" alt="Review platform" class="wp-image-13898"/></figure></div>



<p>Clutch is a verified review platform based in Washington, DC. Their team conducts independent research into the past customers of B2B service providers. This direct feedback ensures that all of their ratings and rankings are fair and transparent. This makes Clutch a reliable source where people post real reviews regarding their collaboration with different agencies.</p>



<p>Their feedback is valuable for both the company and other visitors seeking a software company to start a partnership. People search for testimonials that prove others&#8217; experiences with these companies.</p>



<h2 id="h-tagdiv-is-a-top-b2b-company-in-romania">tagDiv is a top B2B company in Romania</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="150" height="150" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/icon3.png" alt="web development and web design services by tagDiv" class="wp-image-13899"/></figure></div>



<p>Every year,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://clutch.co/press-releases/recognizes-top-b2b-companies-romania-2020">Clutch announces their Leader Awards</a>, the highest-ranking companies, according to geographic location and service line based on customers&#8217; feedback. In August 2020, in less than a year from the moment we&#8217;ve created&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://clutch.co/profile/tagdiv">our profile</a>, tagDiv was named a leader on Clutch reports on the top B2B companies in Bulgaria, Romania, and Serbia.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote is-style-default"><blockquote><p><em><em>We are delighted to have been chosen as one of the leading web development companies for Eastern Europe by Clutch. It&#8217;s nice when Clutch awards our work. Growing from B2C to B2B comes with challenges, and collaborating with Clutch.co is an excellent choice for the tagDiv web development company. It helps us increase our visibility, generating new inquiries, and valuable leads because the prospects find it easy to have the confidence to decide when they see good feedback from other clients.</em></em></p><cite><em><em>Radu Oprea, CEO</em></em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>With over 49,000 companies worldwide featured on the platform, tagDiv is honored to have been selected from such a large pool of firms as a top web development company.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="150" height="150" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/icon4.png" alt="b2b company - tagDiv" class="wp-image-13900"/></figure></div>



<p>Clutch reviewers have directly contacted many of our clients about the services tagDiv delivered to find out details about the project management style, collaboration outcomes, and other relevant information. These reviews are thorough and offer insights that provide a genuine perspective on how a partnership with our company can lead to transformative results.</p>



<p>We are grateful to our customers, especially those who took the time to leave us a Clutch review! Here&#8217;s what they had to say about working with us</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p><em>The tagDiv team were always respectful and didn&#8217;t give up even though I sometimes had a hard time describing what I wanted.</em></p><p></p><cite><em>Owner, Web Development Company</em></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p><em>The new site is now streamlined and eye-catching, meeting the goals and expectations of the internal team. tagDiv provides quality results through a collaborative and timely manner. The team is hard-working and creative.</em></p><cite><em>Director, Marketing &amp; Advertising Startup Company</em></cite></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newspaper theme 10 brings you two wonderful ways to build your WordPress website. For the first time in WordPress, you have the freedom to choose how much code the theme is loading and optimize your website’s performance straight from the beginning.</p>
<p><a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-10/">Newspaper theme 10</a> update introduces a major change in how the theme works and allows you to speed up your website. For this, we’ve added a premium legacy plugin called Standard Pack. It brings you all the previous functionality of the Newspaper Theme. When you deactivate it, your website gains page loading speed. <a href="#Deactivate">Scroll down</a> to learn how to smoothly upgrade from a previous version to Newspaper 10 and build a fast website. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Please read this, don’t scan.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-9775 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/newspaper-10-here.jpg" alt="Say Hello to Newspaper 10" width="1162" height="774" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/newspaper-10-here.jpg 1162w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/newspaper-10-here-300x200.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/newspaper-10-here-768x512.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/newspaper-10-here-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/newspaper-10-here-696x464.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/newspaper-10-here-1068x711.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/newspaper-10-here-631x420.jpg 631w" sizes="(max-width: 1162px) 100vw, 1162px" />Let’s think of it this way: When you use the Standard Pack, your theme is automatically using the easy-to-use, default settings.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the Standard Pack plugin?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>Standard Pack is a premium plugin available to you for free. The new Standard Pack Plugin has two functions: it brings all the functionality you love in the previous versions. It also allows you to separate things when you want to build everything customized and go for website’ performance.</p>
<p>In the previous theme versions, the HTML and CSS code for all these templates were loaded on each page-load of your website, affecting your website’s performance. The headers, shortcodes, blocks, or any other pre-designed elements are all built inside your theme. You just click on the component to select it, made small customizations like choosing colors, and it’s ready to be used. It saves you from diving in CSS and building them yourself. Newspaper Theme with the Standard Pack activated is the theme that you enjoyed before the update.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-9794 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-tagdiv-composer4.jpg" alt="Anyone can use the new tagDiv Composer page builder" width="1200" height="779" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-tagdiv-composer4.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-tagdiv-composer4-300x195.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-tagdiv-composer4-768x499.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-tagdiv-composer4-1024x665.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-tagdiv-composer4-696x452.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-tagdiv-composer4-1068x693.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-tagdiv-composer4-647x420.jpg 647w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who should use the Standard Pack?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to create a website and you have no experience with web design, web development, or WordPress themes, then the Standard Pack plugin is definitely the right choice for you. It allows you to use elements created by our designers and build your website in a few hours without any help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you have experience with WordPress, there may be a moment when you have to create a whole website in the next hour, then using Newspaper Theme with Standard Pack is also the right choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have experience with WordPress and Newspaper Theme and plan to create a blazing fast website, then the Standard Pack plugin is not the best choice. You’ll achieve your goals easier using the Newspaper Theme with tgaDiv Cloud Library and tagDiv Composer to create a website that loads only the necessary code to make it perfect, just as you design it.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to use the Standard Pack?</span></h2>
<p>When you are installing the Newspaper Theme 10, you must&nbsp;go to WordPress Admin area &gt; Newspaper Theme &gt; Plugins and<strong> enable the Standard Pack plugin</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-10078 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/install-standard-pack2.jpg" alt="How to Install Standard Pack" width="1200" height="666" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/install-standard-pack2.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/install-standard-pack2-300x167.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/install-standard-pack2-768x426.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/install-standard-pack2-1024x568.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/install-standard-pack2-696x385.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/install-standard-pack2-1068x593.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/install-standard-pack2-757x420.jpg 757w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p><strong>Experienced WordPress user and installing Newspaper Theme for the first time</strong> &#8211; After you have completed the theme install is to go to the<em> WordPress Admin area &gt; Newspaper Theme &gt; Plugins</em> and deactivate the Standard Pack. Disabling the plugin will help you gain speed for your website. <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-installing-demos/">Load a PRO Demo</a> to have a fast start and don’t forget to cut the development and design time by importing elements and sections from the <a href="https://cloud.tagdiv.com/#/load/All" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tagDiv Cloud Library.</a> Than customize everything with the tagDiv Composer frontend page builder.</p>
<p><strong>Updating Newspaper Theme and planning have the fastest website</strong> &#8211; If your website was created with a <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-whats-new-v-9/">previous version</a> of Newspaper Theme, you should update the theme according to the theme documentation. <span id="Deactivate">Leave the plugin active</span> until all dependencies are removed. What do I mean? For example, your website uses one of the default headers from the theme panel, and you deactivate the Standard Pack, your header will be displayed as a series of text and symbols on the frontend.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deactivate Standard Pack for blazing fast-websites</span></h2>
<p>To gain page loading speed for your website, you’ll need to deactivate the Standard Pack plugin. This step will separate the templates (pages, singles, headers, footer) you’ve created or imported from the tagDiv Cloud Library from the ones built inside the Newspaper theme panel. All of the default templates from the theme and some of the elements from the tagDiv Composer will be disabled by deactivating the Standard Pack.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-10064 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/performance3.jpg" alt="Increase your performance with Newspaper WordPress Theme" width="1200" height="558" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/performance3.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/performance3-300x140.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/performance3-768x357.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/performance3-1024x476.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/performance3-696x324.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/performance3-1068x497.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/performance3-903x420.jpg 903w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>As a result, your website will start to load only the code necessary for the elements you actually use on the website speeding up your website. This means less HTML and CSS to handle and far more performance. This feature is available for both new and existing websites.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easily removing the dependencies</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make the transition from <a href="https://tagdiv.com/whats-new-newspaper-theme-9-8/">9.8</a> to Newspaper 10 with Cloud templates, you need to ensure you gradually and smoothly remove the dependencies. Please read this, don’t scan. Failing in removing dependencies prior to deactivating the Standard Pack will break your website.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to remove dependencies</span></h2>
<p>Removing dependencies means converting all the default theme panel templates to cloud library template which are fully editable using the tagDiv Composer. That can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>PRO Demos</li>
<li>Single Post template</li>
<li>Category Template</li>
<li>Homepage Template</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As in WordPress Standard functionality, Newspaper Theme alters:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single.php (the posts and articles),&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">home.php (your homepage)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archive pages (the archive pages)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">author.php and date.php (the author profile pages)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">category.php, (the categories pages)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tag.php, (the tag pages)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taxonomy.php (the taxonomy pages)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">search.php (the search page)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">header.php</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">footer.php</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sidebar.php</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-9792 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tagdiv-composer-changes2.jpg" alt="The new changes in tagDiv Composer" width="1200" height="500" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tagdiv-composer-changes2.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tagdiv-composer-changes2-300x125.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tagdiv-composer-changes2-768x320.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tagdiv-composer-changes2-1024x427.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tagdiv-composer-changes2-696x290.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tagdiv-composer-changes2-1068x445.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tagdiv-composer-changes2-1008x420.jpg 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Here’s the complete list of templates influenced by the Standard Pack plugin:</p>
<p><strong>In the theme panel</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>15 Headers</li>
<li>8 Category templates</li>
<li>10 Big Grids</li>
<li>19 Modules for blocks</li>
<li>14 Single post styles</li>
<li>14 Footer templates</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the tagDiv Composer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>25 Blocks</li>
<li>12 Big Grids</li>
<li>10 Big Grid Full</li>
<li>1 Big Grid Slide</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extra</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All the demos that are not marked as PRO Demos.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your website uses any of the templates present there, you must replace it with its equivalent from the tagDiv Cloud Library.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve made it easy for you and recreated them. Almost every template from the theme panel already exists in the</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.tagdiv.com/#/load/Blocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tagDiv Cloud Library</a>.<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;It should be easy to find the one that’s closer to your brand and import it on your website. Customize it using tagDiv Composer and assign it to replace the existing one.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must find and replace templates until you’ve completed the process. Then simply deactivate the Standard Pack, and you are ready for speed and performance.</span></p>
<p>If you deactivate the plugin, it’s like you hit a magic button, and you get absolute freedom and performance. Keep on reading as I’ll give you all the information on using Newspaper Theme and Standard Pack you need to make your website blazing-fast.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take your website to the next level</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, if using the <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newspaper theme</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;with the Standard Pack plugin is like taking a shortcut straight to the treasure room, while with the Cloud Templates is the happy ending you’ve always dreamed of.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is Newspaper Theme the right theme for web developers with large clients portfolio? We&#8217;ll find the answer by interviewing Amit Malewar, a professional web designer who built hundreds of sites over the last 12 years. He is a WordPress website developer who created over 28 websites using Newspaper theme. We are thrilled to share with you a professional&#8217; thoughts about our product, and how he uses it on various websites, in this comprehensive Newspaper Theme Case Study.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-article-img-border alignright wp-image-7886" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Amit_Malewar_Indian_Developer_owner_Tech_Explorist_Infophilic.jpg" alt="Amit Malewar, Indian Web Developer, owner Tech Explorist &amp; Infophilic" width="154" height="154" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Amit_Malewar_Indian_Developer_owner_Tech_Explorist_Infophilic.jpg 400w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Amit_Malewar_Indian_Developer_owner_Tech_Explorist_Infophilic-150x150.jpg 150w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Amit_Malewar_Indian_Developer_owner_Tech_Explorist_Infophilic-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 154px) 100vw, 154px" />Amit Malewar (27) developed, designed, and curated many websites of his hundreds of happy clients using Newspaper Theme. Also, he is the founder of <a href="https://www.techexplorist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechExplorist</a> (one of the top 3 science news portals and the only science news site in India), <a href="https://www.inceptivemind.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inceptive Mind</a>, and <a href="https://www.infophilic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infophilic</a> websites.</p>
<h2>The challenge</h2>
<p>He started in 2010, and by 2015 Amit was already creating websites for his clients. His dream was to be amongst the top developers, to find the best solutions for his customers and to explore new possibilities. So, the idea of the Tech Explorist website started to take shape into a plan. The developer had all the technical skills, but no time to write the code for it. So, he begins to search for &#8220;the best&#8221; theme for WordPress.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found Newspaper Theme in top list on Themeforest. First, I checked the launch date of the theme and the last update date. The premium product I was searching for had to be SEO Friendly, and I was interested in having the lazy load feature. At that time, Newspaper was the only theme with this set of features.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7880 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article.jpg" alt="Newspaper Case Study: Article in the Tech Explorist website" width="1200" height="700" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article-300x175.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article-768x448.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article-696x406.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article-1068x623.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article-720x420.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>The design, flexibility, and general appearance were as important as the Tech Explorist website I was working on are all about technology and innovation news, highlighting the scientific discoveries, inventions, health and groundbreaking researches that shape human living.</p>
<p>I was also searching for a theme that had Custom Ad spaces with easy to customize panel. And of course, fast page load speed. The Newspaper theme undoubtedly met all my expectations, that&#8217;s why I am currently using it on all of my websites&#8221;, recalls Amit about the first encounter with the tagDiv&#8217; theme.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>&#8220;It took me one or two hours to read the documents and complete the installation process. By the way, you guys got the best documentation. I had posted some questions on the forum when I was playing/trying new things with the theme. The support is awesome, and they quickly helped me understand how some things were working. The best part of the support forum is transparency&#8221;, says the developer.</p>
<h2>Solution on action</h2>
<p>The Indian developer created 28 websites, including three of his own using the Newspaper theme. His is relying on the<a href="https://tagdiv.com/mobile-theme-automatic-optimization-for-mobile-newspaper-theme/">&nbsp;mobile theme plugin</a> as it &#8220;really makes the site faster for mobile users.&#8221; When you&#8217;re web designing for a living, it&#8217;s the little things that make the difference between an enormous project you love to create and some other project. The inbuilt <a href="https://tagdiv.com/social-network-buttons/">sharing buttons</a> work way better than any other premium plugins available in the market.</p>
<blockquote class="td_pull_quote td_pull_center"><p>This theme has a way to stick into the people&#8217;s mind</p></blockquote>
<p>What I enjoy most about the<a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Newspaper theme</a> is the design, the feeling it gives you. I work it for almost four years, and I still believe Newspaper brings you a more professional design and feel out-of-the-box as compared to many other popular premium themes. Six of my clients contacted me because they just wanted a design similar to techexplorist.com ?. On my websites, people are asking me things related to Newspaper; some want to know what plugins I am using. And so on. This theme has a way to stick into the people&#8217;s mind,&#8221; says Amit Malewar.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7876 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging.jpg" alt="Newspaper Theme Customer Review: Infophilic Simplifying Blogging website" width="1200" height="665" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging-300x166.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging-768x426.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging-1024x567.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging-696x385.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging-1068x592.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging-758x420.jpg 758w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>For the Newspaper Theme case study, we asked the web developer to share with us his favorite tools. &#8220;<a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics/">tagDiv Composer </a>and the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/what-is-the-cloud-library/">Cloud Library</a>. These plugins make Newspaper Theme more flexible and give me endless design possibilities. The new builder made customization super easy. I can customize any <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-composer-shortcodes-and-elements/">element</a>/module or <a href="https://tagdiv.com/newspaper-theme-customize-the-header-manager/">header</a> in minutes and create a brand new website in a day or two after completing a discussion and planning with the client&#8221;, explains Amit.</p>
<h2>The results: Significantly increasing in revenue</h2>
<p>Speeding up the development time while making the customers delighted by your work is something that many designers dream of achieving. Is it possible with the Newspaper theme? Amit explains it for us &#8220;As a developer, undoubtedly it helped me increased revenue. I can finish a project faster and create another website as the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/using-typography-presets-newspaper-theme/">cycle of design</a> is much shorter.</p>
<p>This theme is the best in terms of customizability and for SEO. It increases the number of page views and visitors on the site because the mobile version is fast. On my website, before using Newspaper, I had 1 &#8211; 2k page views in a day. Now, we have almost 50 &#8211; 80k page views/day and some of my clients have 150 &#8211; 200K page views per day using Newspaper Theme&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you just start your blog with Newspaper Theme? Great! In this article, we explain how to power up your website with valuable insights using Google Analytics. With accurate data about your audience &#8211; age, gender, location, traffic source (how they landed on your site), the most popular content on your website and conversions &#8211; you can plan effective business strategies and grow your business faster. Are you asking yourself why you should use it?</p>
<p>I’ve made a list of the four main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It tells you which channel drives traffic to your website</li>
<li>It shows you which marketing channels are better at <a href="https://tagdiv.com/tricks-web-designers-use-to-boost-conversion/">converting the visitor</a> to customer</li>
<li>It brings you data about the demographic characteristics of your audience helping you to be more effective</li>
<li>It enables you to analyze your efforts and pages based on data, not hunches.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list can go on, but I think we can move on and start with the basics.</p>

<h2>Analytics 101: How to set up your Google Analytics</h2>
<p>Google Analytics is created by Google to help website owners understand their customers. If you are a publisher and your goal is to bring visitors back to read more of your amazing content or an e-commerce website that aims to get as many conversions, as fast as possible, <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google Analytics</a> is&nbsp;the free tool you need to analyze data and grow your business.</p>
<h3>Create a Google Analytics account</h3>
<p>To set up a Google Analytics account, you need a Google Account. Think of your Google account as the access point for all your Google products and tools. If you don&#8217;t have a Google account yet, it takes a few minutes to <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&amp;flowEntry=SignUp" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">create a new one</a>.</p>

<p>Once it is done, you can create a new<a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Google Analytics account</a>. Click the button, and you&#8217;ll be redirected to the setup page. The <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Analytics help</a> is quite comprehensive, and you&#8217;ll go through the process in no time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7935 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account.png" alt="Google Analytics Setup Your Account" width="1200" height="900" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account.png 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-300x225.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-768x576.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-1024x768.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-80x60.png 80w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-265x198.png 265w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-696x522.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-1068x801.png 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google-Analytics-Setup-An-Account-560x420.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to give your Analytics an account name, enter your website name, and add your domain name. After you complete these steps, Google will automatically generate your tracking code for the website.</p>
<p><iframe class="td-extend-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lZf3YYkIg8w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>With this, the basic setup is ready. Theoretically, now all you have to do is add the Google Analytics script to the &lt;head&gt; tag and see the data flowing in after 24 hours. But practically, &#8230; it&#8217;s not! Think about it: how does Analytics suppose to know what actions are essential to you on your website? Are you selling something? Are you aiming for leads? It’s engagement on content vital? If you insert the script in the site now, you&#8217;ll be missing out almost all the goodies.</p>
<h2>2. Clear objectives = Great, insightful data</h2>
<p>Yeah! You must change the Google Analytics script to track actions and metrics that are important on your website. If you have some Java or PHP skills, you can do it by yourself. If not, you can hire a developer to do it for you as this step is a heavy technical one.</p>
<p>But first, you need to get things crystal clear in mind about your website objectives. Make a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the key pages, shopping cart pages?</li>
<li>File downloads like .pdfs, apps you want to track inside Google Analytics</li>
<li>On-page events like video views, forms, button clicks</li>
<li>Does this site need e-commerce tracking?</li>
<li>What are the critical conversion points like &#8220;thank you&#8221; pages, signups, lead capture pages, newsletters?</li>
</ul>
<p>After generating this list, you should have a clear idea about what do you need to track as actions and conversions on your website. Your Google Analytics should focus on your essential metrics and help you to reach your objectives. Let&#8217;s see some example of objectives with potential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Key Performance Indicators</a> defined.</p>
<blockquote class="td_pull_quote td_pull_left"><p>According to <a href="https://www.klipfolio.com/resources/articles/what-is-a-key-performance-indicator" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Klipfolio</a><br />
A Key Performance Indicator is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving key business objectives. High-level KPIs may focus on the overall performance of the business, while low-level KPIs may focus on processes in departments such as sales, marketing, HR, support and others</p></blockquote>
<h3>Objectives and KPIs</h3>
<p><strong>Objective Pageviews/traffic:</strong><br />
<strong>Potential KPIs:</strong> Total pageviews, sessions by source/medium, top landing pages, top organic keywords, page value, time on page, goal conversions.</p>
<p><strong>Objective e-commerce/sales:</strong><br />
<strong>Potential KPIs:</strong> Total revenue, e-commerce conversion rate, page value, conversion rate by source/medium, sales by product category, return on ad spend (ROAS), conversion rate by gender/age and interest category, conversion rate by external campaign name.</p>
<p><strong>Objective lead generation:</strong><br />
<strong>Potential KPIs:</strong> Goal conversions, conversion rate by landing page, page value, conversion rate by source/medium, conversion rate by gender/age and interest category, contact form submissions by landing page.</p>
<p><strong>Objective affiliate/commission-based programs:</strong><br />
<strong>Potential KPIs:</strong> Outbound clicks per landing page, content group conversion rates, page value, traffic by source/medium, top landing pages, top external links clicked by page.</p>
<p>Decide what are the most valued KPIs for your website&#8217;s objectives and customize the tracking code to make sure this fantastic tool called Google Analytics brings you all the essential metrics in a way you can easily understand and make strategic decisions.</p>
<h2>3. How to customize the tracking code to see everything that&#8217;s important</h2>
<p>If you are selling something on your website, the first thing you&#8217;ll want to do is activate the Ecommerce tracking. Navigate to the Admin panel &gt; View level and enable the Ecommerce settings. That&#8217;s easy. Now comes the technical part. Head over <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/ecommerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google Analytics reference guide</a> and check the instructions for sending data about transactions and/or item metrics to your Google Analytics.</p>
<p><code>ga('ecommerce:addTransaction', {<br />
'id': '1234', &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Transaction ID. Required.<br />
'affiliation': 'Acme Clothing', &nbsp; // Affiliation or store name.<br />
'revenue': '11.99', &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Grand Total.<br />
'shipping': '5', &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Shipping.<br />
'tax': '1.29' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Tax.<br />
});</code></p>
<p>For content creators and publishers, e-commerce tracking is useless. Adding custom dimensions like Author or seeing engagement on AMP traffic in Google Analytics, it&#8217;s another story and could be a gold mine to grow your website.</p>
<p><code>ga('send', 'pageview', {<br />
'dimension5': '&lt;!--?=$author?'&gt;<br />
});</code></p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve made all these customizations on the code, it should be ready to install on the page.</p>
<h2>4. Installing the Google Analytics script in Newspaper Theme</h2>
<p>Go to your <strong>Google Analytics Account &gt;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Admin panel Property</strong>, open the <strong>Tracking Info</strong> section, and click the <strong>Tracking Code</strong> option. Copy the Global Site Tag and add the sitewide customizations you&#8217;ve made in the previous step. Here is an example of customized code.</p>
<p><code>ga("create", "UA-XXXXXXXX-1", "auto", {<br />
name: "author_analytics",<br />
allowLinker: true,<br />
storage: "none",<br />
clientId: clientId,<br />
alwaysSendReferrer: true<br />
});<br />
} else {<br />
ga("create", "UA-XXXXXXXX-1", "auto", {<br />
name: "author_analytics",<br />
allowLinker: true,<br />
alwaysSendReferrer: true<br />
});<br />
}<br />
ga("author_analytics.send", "pageview");<br />
</code></p>
<p>When you are using the <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newspaper Theme</a> or a <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newsmag-news-magazine-newspaper/9512331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsmag Theme</a> on your website, adding the tracking code is easy. Navigate to your website <strong>WordPress Admin</strong> area &gt; <strong>Newspaper</strong> &gt; <strong>Theme Panel</strong> &gt;<strong> Analytics/JS Codes</strong> section and paste the code in the &#8220;<strong>Head Script Code</strong>&#8221; box. Hit the <strong>Save</strong> Button.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7967 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code.png" alt="Newspaper Theme: How to add Google Analytics code to track traffic on WordPress Website" width="1200" height="781" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code.png 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code-300x195.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code-768x500.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code-1024x666.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code-696x453.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code-1068x695.png 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-How-to-add-Google-Analytics-Code-645x420.png 645w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Now, verify if the code is present in the page by opening the page in the browser, in the Incognito mode, and search in the source of the page for &#8220;gtag.js.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="td_pull_quote td_pull_left"><p>Tip: If you are using a caching plugin, consider clearing the cache after adding the Google Analytics tag.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Newspaper Theme will automatically insert your script on every page, sitewide, and you don&#8217;t have to worry about it. Even after updating the theme and/or WordPress, your tracking will still be present on your WordPress.</p>
<p>In Newspaper Theme, you can add all the tracking codes in the Analytics section and forget about them.</p>
<h2>5. Using Google Analytics Events</h2>
<p>After you&#8217;ve added the script, you should see the data about your traffic flowing in the first 24 hours. You can see insightful data about your audience: age, sex, location, where are they coming from, how do they interact with your pages.</p>
<p>But when dive into data, you&#8217;ll notice that your tracking is at the page level, and this means that you can&#8217;t see any data about how visitors clicked the buttons, links, calls to action or video plays. For this, you still need to take an additional step and <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033068?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1033067" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">create events</a> for Google Analytics.</p>
<h3>What is a Google Analytics event?</h3>
<p>According to Google, &#8220;events are user interactions with content that can be tracked independently from a web page or a screen load (&#8230;) Downloads, mobile ad clicks, gadgets, Flash elements, AJAX embedded elements, and video plays are all examples of actions you might want to track as Events.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can also use <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033068?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1033067" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google Analytics Events</a> to track interactions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of clicks on a button</li>
<li>Number of clicks to outbound links</li>
<li>How much time the audience watched a video</li>
<li>Form abandonment</li>
<li>Number of times users downloaded a file</li>
<li>Number of times visitors shared a blog post</li>
</ul>
<p>The event tracking code has four elements: <strong>category, action, label</strong>, and <strong>value</strong>. The tracking code snippet example:</p>
<p><code>onclick=ga(‘send’, ‘event’, [eventCategory], [eventAction], [eventLabel], [eventValue]);</code></p>
<p>Replace the placeholders with your customized elements based on the events you want to track. Then place the entire code snippet on your page.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7970 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer.png" alt="Newspaper Theme: Adding Tracking on button for newsletter in tagDiv Composer" width="1200" height="881" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer.png 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer-300x220.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer-768x564.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer-1024x752.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer-80x60.png 80w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer-696x511.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer-1068x784.png 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Newspaper-Theme-Adding-Tracking-on-buttons-newsletter-tagdiv-composer-572x420.png 572w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve made the change to the code, you can track the activity on buttons or form submissions. In the Newspaper Theme, you can add events right on the element. Simply add the info into the Tracking section, and the theme implements it for you.</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>Tip: Don&#8217;t forget to generate a list of the events you need to create to reach your website objectives. The purpose is always to have a clear image of your events, as Google Analytics is generating so much information that is easy to lose track of the essential.</p></blockquote>
<h2>6. Tracking traffic with UTM parameters</h2>
<p>If you want to track your efforts to drive traffic to your website from your email, PPC, and referral traffic using Google Analytics, you need to use campaign tracking. You can easily create UTM parameters and bring external data to your Google Analytics account.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve shown you how to customize the tracking code to send meaningful data to your Google Analytics account to help you understand who is your audience and how your visitors interact with your website. The <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033863" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Campaign tracking</a> doesn&#8217;t require the modification of the tag in the site, as it is used on the link level.</p>
<h3>What are the UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) parameters?</h3>
<p>&#8220;UTM parameters are simply tags that you add to a URL. When someone clicks on a URL with UTM parameters, those tags are sent back to your Google Analytics for tracking.&#8221;, according to Kissmetrics.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7979 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UTM-parameters-campaing-tracking-structure.jpg" alt="The structure of a link with UTM parameters for campaign tracking" width="1200" height="300" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UTM-parameters-campaing-tracking-structure.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UTM-parameters-campaing-tracking-structure-300x75.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UTM-parameters-campaing-tracking-structure-768x192.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UTM-parameters-campaing-tracking-structure-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UTM-parameters-campaing-tracking-structure-696x174.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UTM-parameters-campaing-tracking-structure-1068x267.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>The UTM parameters and UTM tracking are straightforward to use and highly effective in finding out which links are the most effective in driving traffic to your content.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">five UTM parameters</a>:<br />
<code>utm_source</code> &#8211; Identifies which site sent the traffic like Facebook or your email newsletter, and is a required parameter.<br />
<code>utm_medium</code> &#8211; Identifies what type of link was used, such as cost per click or social media, affiliate, and so on.<br />
<code>utm_campaign</code> &#8211; Identifies a specific product promotion or strategic campaign.<br />
<code>utm_term</code> &#8211; Identifies search terms.<br />
<code>utm_content</code> &#8211; Identifies the clicked content that brought the user to the site. It is a good solution for A/B testing and content-targeted ads.</p>
<h3>How to create a link with UTM parameters?</h3>
<p>Let me introduce you to the <a href="https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google Analytics Campaign URL Builder</a>. It&#8217;s a form inside the Google Analytics help center. You can complete it to add the information to your link automatically. When you are done, copy the link and paste it where you need it. No coding skills are required.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7974 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder.png" alt="Analytics Campaign URL Builder: How to create a custom UTM Parameters " width="1200" height="1069" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder.png 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder-300x267.png 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder-768x684.png 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder-1024x912.png 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder-696x620.png 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder-1068x951.png 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Analytics-Campaign-URL-Builder-471x420.png 471w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>URL tracking is straightforward to set up and use providing precious insights about your traffic. But, only if you send data into a clear, easy to understand way.</p>
<h3>Be consistent with your UTM parameters</h3>
<p>Create a convention to help you be consistent in naming your campaigns and avoid a lot of confusion in data analysis. The recommendations are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use dashes</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t repeat yourself</li>
<li>Keep it simple</li>
<li>Make your parameters easy to read</li>
</ul>
<h3>Track your UTM parameters in a spreadsheet</h3>
<p>Make your life easy and record all the links with parameters in a spreadsheet. Every time you need to create a new one, you&#8217;ll know exactly what campaigns and parameters you&#8217;ve already used.</p>
<p>Also, it will help your team use the same conventions, ultimately keeping your Analytics data clean and clear. You can use a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xDl9GdpuWB9kzXzWxKj3NYt392T6l6Tq9e89Yieg8AM/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free spreadsheet template</a> like the one shared by Sam Wiltshire to get started or simply create a new one.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Now, that you have the tracking setup on your website and you are receiving data from your marketing efforts, take a look at the reports in Google Analytics at least once a week.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>tagDiv was awarded by Envato with WP Requirements Compliant Badge. We want to thank you, our customers from our hearts. You’ve supported us in one of the most challenging refactorization processes we have ever enterprised. Thank you! This moment is a new start, as it opens new possibilities for future outstanding implementations.</p>
<p>For the last six months, our developers managed to surgically move hundreds of features, blocks, widgets, and settings. <a href="https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000472383-WordPress-Theme-Requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Envato required us</a> – the theme authors – to change the products to provide only WordPress basic functionality by May 31, 2019.</p>
<h2>Rewriting the Core of the tagDiv Themes</h2>
<p>Above all, to comply with the new Envato WordPress Quality standards, we faced a significant challenge. In short, rewriting the theme’s code while over 95,500 clients are actively using our products. And to do it without disrupting the customer experience and their websites.</p>
<p>So, we’ve made a plan and created a sequence of four successive updates that gradually rewrote the core of the themes. The first two of them made the changes that empowered the tagDiv Composer page builder plugin to support all the changes.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve anticipated that the third update was going to be the most challenging for you, our clients. Therefore, we’ve spent over two months preparing for the worst while hoping for the best. We tried to replicate all the possible update conditions, in dozens of “maybe” configuration and scenarios determined to identify and fix all issues from the candidate versions.</p>

<p>On April 17, 2019, the most significant <a href="https://tagdiv.com/updating-the-core-of-tagdiv-themes/">update</a> in the sequence was released on the Newspaper Theme, and a few days later on the Newsmag Theme. The updates surgically moved the biggest part of the code from the theme into the tagDiv Composer page builder. However, with all our effort, from over 95,500 customers, more the 600 needed our help with the update and came to the support center. Our team &#8211; support and development &#8211; worked extra hours to help the customers make the update properly and also fixing particular issues on their websites as fast as possible.</p>
<p>The last change came on May 28, 2019, ending the most challenging refactorization process we’ve ever enterprised.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your website ready to conquer the internet? For the first time, you can use the Mobile Theme with the Official AMP plugin to get the best results with the <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newsmag-news-magazine-newspaper/9512331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsmag theme</a>. Discover how to make your pages AMP with Newsmag Theme to display content for mobile users with this tutorial.</p>
<h2>How to install AMP in Newsmag Theme</h2>
<p>To use the AMP plugin, you first need to install it.<br />
Step 1. Go to your WordPress Admin area &gt; Newsmag &gt; Plugins section.<br />
Step 2. Click the Install button for both the AMP and <a href="https://tagdiv.com/mobile-theme-get-mobile-ready-with-newsmag-theme/">Mobile Theme</a> plugin.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7452 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile11.jpg" alt="Newsmag Theme: How to install plugins" width="1200" height="662" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile11.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile11-300x166.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile11-768x424.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile11-1024x565.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile11-696x385.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile11-1068x589.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile11-761x420.jpg 761w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>You need to activate both plugins because they work together to give you all the options you need to optimize your website for small screen users.</p>
<p>Equally important, we’ve removed the previous tagDiv AMP plugin as it was built on the AMP initial launch implementation. The latest updates for the plugin opened new possibilities for your website and, now we’ve made all of them available for you.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">[Action required]: If you’ve used the previous tagDiv AMP plugin when updating to the Newsmag v. 4.8, the theme automatically deactivates your AMP functionality. You need to activate the Mobile Theme and AMP plugins to restore the functionality.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>However, it’s straightforward, and I’ll guide you step by step. Now, let start with some explanations about how this mobile optimization works.</p>
<h3>How to use the new AMP with Newsmag Theme</h3>
<p>The Accelerated Mobile Pages functionality is integrated into the Mobile Theme plugin. This way you can have all the small screens devices features on your AMP pages.</p>
<p>Furthermore, deep integration allows you to customize the way you want to optimize your users’ experience. In Newsmag Theme you can choose the Mobile Theme and AMP settings that best suit your project:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7438 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp1.jpg" alt="Customizing AMP with Newsmag Theme" width="1200" height="872" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp1.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp1-300x218.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp1-768x558.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp1-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp1-324x235.jpg 324w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp1-696x506.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp1-1068x776.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp1-578x420.jpg 578w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> – Displays content using the Mobile Theme on small screen devices (no AMP)</li>
<li><strong>Mobile+AMP</strong> – Displays content using the Mobile Theme on both mobiles and AMP</li>
<li><strong>AMP</strong> – Uses the responsive version of the theme on small screen devices and Mobile Theme only on AMP.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Customizing AMP Settings</h2>
<p>Now, all the Menus, Search button, Backgrounds, Colors, Excerpts, Ads, Custom code, work seamlessly with your AMP pages and displays content for mobile users. You can access the AMP plugin settings in the Newsmag &gt; Theme Panel &gt; Mobile Theme settings section.<br />
For more details, please read our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/mobile-theme-get-mobile-ready-with-newsmag-theme/">Mobile Theme Plugin Tutorial</a>.</p>
<h3>Speed up your mobile website</h3>
<p>Adverts are vital for monetizing, yet ads are often slowing your site down. Speeding up your ads is a great way to <a href="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-set-up-cloudflare-cdn/">boost performance</a>. The Newsmag Theme integrated ad system also works for AMP advertising to make it easier for you to increase your revenue.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7439 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp2.jpg" alt="Newsmag Theme: AMP Ads in the Mobile Theme" width="1200" height="807" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp2.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp2-768x516.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp2-1024x689.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp2-696x468.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp2-1068x718.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp2-625x420.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>In the Mobile Theme, Newsmag has six spots where you can place ads. You also have an implementation available for <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-auto-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adsense Auto Ads for AMP</a>. You can now integrate such ads in the AMP ads section right from the Mobile Theme settings.</p>
<h3>Track to improve results</h3>
<p>With the AMP implementation, you can track your site traffic even on AMP content. All you have to do is access the Theme Panel &gt; Mobile Theme &gt; AMP Analytics, and paste your Google Analytics code. This section allows you to place the AMP Analytics code in the template header, so you can track user interactions with AMP pages.</p>
<p>For the AMP Analytics Code to function correctly, please use the following implementation:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7440 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp3.jpg" alt="Newsmag Theme: Tracking settings for Google Analytics" width="1200" height="612" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp3.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp3-300x153.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp3-768x392.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp3-1024x522.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp3-696x355.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp3-1068x545.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp3-824x420.jpg 824w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>If you want to use other tracking codes like the Facebook Pixel or Hotjar, you can add the scripts, one under the other, in the AMP plugin settings &gt; Analytics.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7463 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp7.jpg" alt="Newsmag AMP Tutorial: Adding tracking scripts" width="1200" height="428" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp7.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp7-300x107.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp7-768x274.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp7-1024x365.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp7-696x248.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp7-1068x381.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp7-1178x420.jpg 1178w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p><strong>Notice:</strong> In the Mobile Theme Analytics Code use only the Google Analytics code. When adding the Facebook Pixel, Hotjar or other scripts in the AMP plugin settings, please do not insert the Google Analytics code again as it will also duplicate your data.</p>
<h2>Verifying results</h2>
<p>You can verify that everything’s working properly, using the browser emulator or the <a href="https://search.google.com/test/amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMP testing tool</a>. To see a preview of your amp template, add “/?amp” at the end of the URL, and the theme does the rest. If you’re logged in, we recommend disabling the admin bar for AMP pages from the official plugin settings while testing your AMP functionality.</p>
<p>Important note:<br />
The “Supported templates” settings enable or disable AMP for specific templates. Make sure the template you want AMP to use on is active in this screen.</p>

<p>You can enable or disable AMP for specific posts, pages, categories from the WordPress editor for better control over specific localized activation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7442 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp5.jpg" alt="Editing AMP in Newsmag Theme" width="1200" height="431" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp5.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp5-300x108.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp5-768x276.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp5-1024x368.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp5-696x250.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp5-1068x384.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amp5-1169x420.jpg 1169w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Mobile pages should be light and fast! This way, they can keep the reader engaged and maintain return visits into favorable values. You can get a higher rank in Google search with the AMP pages and quality content. Thanks to the instant loading, the time spent on page increases, as well as the CTRs, and the bounce rates drop consistently. Try the Mobile Theme and AMP on <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newsmag-news-magazine-newspaper/9512331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsmag Theme</a> to see the change in your mobile optimization!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://tagdiv.com/updating-the-core-of-tagdiv-themes/">Newsmag Theme v. 4.8</a> brings you a new tool to help you make your website a great experience on small screen devices. The Mobile Theme is specially designed to maximize the theme performance on mobile devices. Read below to find out how to make your website mobile ready with the <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/newsmag-news-magazine-newspaper/9512331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsmag Theme</a>.</p>
<p>Every day you’re facing the ultimate challenge: creating excellent content while making sure it delivers in the right, astounding form to your audience. Yes, sometimes, navigating the web from mobile can be frustrating. The causes are multiple: some pages are slow on loading, banners blocking the content, a text is too small and hard to read, low-quality images, buttons that are too close to each other, and so on. To give the tools to solve all the issues, we built the “Mobile theme.”</p>
<h2>What is Mobile Theme?</h2>
<p>The Mobile Theme is a lighter, performance optimized template included in the Newsmag package and it loads ONLY on mobile devices. The Mobile theme comes with a dedicated template for pages, posts, categories, and more. It’s a new architecture that gives your audience an engaging way to interact with your website.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7447 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/newsmag-mobile-theme.jpg" alt="Newsmag Theme: Introducing Mobile theme" width="1200" height="660" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/newsmag-mobile-theme.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/newsmag-mobile-theme-300x165.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/newsmag-mobile-theme-768x422.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/newsmag-mobile-theme-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/newsmag-mobile-theme-696x383.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/newsmag-mobile-theme-1068x587.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/newsmag-mobile-theme-764x420.jpg 764w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Carefully tuned, each template comes with optimal performance and excellent user experience. The posts have a predefined, clean format including all the features available on the main theme. On the homepage, it automatically renders a grid that contains featured posts and a latest posts section.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-article-img-border aligncenter wp-image-7449 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile10.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="965" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile10.jpg 376w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile10-117x300.jpg 117w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile10-164x420.jpg 164w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" /></p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>The Mobile theme ensures maximum performance. Once activated, a new panel becomes available in the Theme Panel area to allow you to customize various parameters for the “Mobile theme.”</p>
<h3>How to install the mobile theme:</h3>
<p>You can install and activate the plugin from your WordPress admin area &gt; Newsmag &gt; Theme Panel &gt; Plugins.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7410 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile1.jpg" alt="tagDiv Mobile Theme: How to install" width="1200" height="662" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile1.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile1-300x166.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile1-768x424.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile1-1024x565.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile1-696x385.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile1-1068x589.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile1-761x420.jpg 761w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Customize pages for Mobile theme:</h3>
<p>For Homepage, the “Mobile Theme” brings you a predefined page template that includes two sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>top grid</strong> – displays three featured posts (posts included in the Featured Category)</li>
<li><strong>latest articles</strong> – shows the latest articles</li>
</ul>
<p>The template is displayed only if the page is set as a Static Page. You can check out the page settings in the WordPress Admin panel Settings-&gt;Reading section.</p>
<h3>How to add images, custom HTML or text?</h3>
<p>Do you want to bring custom elements into the Mobile Editor? Great. Just edit the page.</p>

<p>On the front-end, you&#8217;ll find the custom elements displayed between the Top Grid and the Latest Articles section.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-article-img-border wp-image-7450 size-full aligncenter" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile12.jpg" alt="Newsmag Theme: Adding Custom Code to Mobile Theme" width="377" height="857" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile12.jpg 377w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile12-132x300.jpg 132w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile12-185x420.jpg 185w" sizes="(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px" /></p>
<h3>Important note:</h3>
<p><strong>Regular pages</strong> – The content of custom pages (ex. Contact Us page), present on the desktop version of Newsmag theme, are not displayed on the “Mobile theme.” The mobile version gives you the possibility to add content designed for mobiles. This offers you the opportunity to present the same content in two different ways, one optimized for desktops and another for mobiles.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/w7SD9idDEDg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Page builder elements</strong></a> – For optimal performance, you cannot use the page builder elements for the “Mobile theme” pages. If you want to display the same items on both mobile and desktop, deactivate the Mobile theme. Your website built on Newsmag theme will still look awesome on mobiles due to its responsive design. The Mobile Theme is optional, and it enhances the small screen user experience.</p>

<p><strong>Caching</strong>: The Mobile Theme works seamlessly with the WP Super Cache plugin. For more details, visit the <a href="https://forum.tagdiv.com/cache-plugin-install-and-configure/">Cache plugin – install and configure</a> page.</p>
<h3>The Mobile Theme Settings:</h3>
<p>After the plugin is installed a new section called “Mobile Theme” appears in&nbsp;the Newsmag -&gt; Theme Panel area. The options allow you to customize the look and functionality of the mobile theme, including the AMP.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7414 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile6.jpg" alt="Newsmag Theme: Mobile Theme Settings" width="1200" height="1041" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile6.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile6-300x260.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile6-768x666.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile6-1024x888.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile6-534x462.jpg 534w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile6-696x604.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile6-1068x926.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mobile6-484x420.jpg 484w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2>AMP implementation</h2>
<p>In Newsmag Theme v. 4.8, the tagDiv AMP plugin was discontinued. If you used the plugin before the update, you’ll find that the Newsmag 4.8 version disabled you website AMP functionality.</p>
<p>The AMP functionality is integrated into the mobile theme plugin for faster and better results. Furthermore, the settings from the mobile theme will transform your AMP pages into beautiful layouts. Read our <a href="https://tagdiv.com/blazing-fast-websites-how-to-optimize-amp-with-newsmag-theme/">Newsmag Theme AMP Tutorial</a> to get the best results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Notice: You need to Manually Activate the tagDiv Composer Page Builder after Updating to Newspaper Theme v. 9.7.3 and Newsmag Theme v. 4.9 &#8211; Scroll down for instructions</span></p></blockquote>
<p>This is it! The change we’re working on for months is ready. The tagDiv themes are updated to meet the new Envato WP Requirements. It’s an exciting moment as we dove into the core of themes and redesign them to open new possibilities for future implementations. Read below to see the tagDiv themes changes and how they affect you.</p>
<p>They say “it’s only after you’ve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.” Well, the new quality standards of the Envato Market forced us to stop what we were doing and rethink the way Newspaper and Newsmag Theme work.</p>
<h2>Why we are updating the core of the themes</h2>
<p>In summary, the Envato market <a href="https://help.author.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000472383-WordPress-Theme-Requirements">required</a> us &#8211; the theme and plugin authors &#8211; to restructure the products to provide only WordPress basic functionality by May 31, 2019. Just like the other authors that have products created a few years ago, we faced two significant challenges.</p>
<p>First, we had to make the themes compliant and still provide our customers with all the tools they need to build amazing websites. Our products have hundreds of features, blocks, sorting options, custom widgets, and a myriad of custom settings.</p>
<p>Secondly, we have over 90,000 clients that love our products. All the changes had to be implemented without disrupting the customer experience and their websites.</p>
<h2>So, what’s going to change?</h2>
<p>As the first step to a lighter template, we’ve decided the best course of action for a smooth transition is to move all the functionality previously part of the theme into the tagDiv Composer page builder. What happens when you are updating your<strong> Newspaper Theme to version 9.7.3 and Newsmag Theme to version 4.9</strong>? The entire code that brings you the features that you love, other than basic WordPress functionality, will be moved in the page builder.</p>
<p>The tagDiv Composer page builder now includes all the functionality. As a result, your website maintains its design and flexibility you are used to. The change will be a different code structure.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap dropcap3" style="background-color: #ff0000; color: #ff7979; font-family: roboto; font-size: 85px; margin: 27px 9px 27px 0;">!</span> The new code structure may interfere with your child theme customizations. If you’ve made changes only in the functions.php and style.css files, your modifications are safe.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> In case you’ve altered other files, before updating your theme, please create a test environment and check out the changes there, not on your live website.</span></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t use a Child Theme, read the update instructions below:</p>
<h2>What do you need to do?</h2>
<p>To get all the benefits of your theme, you first need to update it. We’ve included a new section in the Welcome screen to facilitate the plugins&#8217; install and/or upgrade.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Backup your website<br />
<strong>Step 2.</strong> Update your theme &#8211; How to <a href="https://tagdiv.com/update-newspaper-theme/">update the Newspaper Theme </a>and <a href="https://forum.tagdiv.com/newsmag-how-to-update-the-theme/">Newsmag Theme</a>.<br />
<strong>Step 3.</strong> Activate the theme<br />
<strong>Step 4</strong>. We’ve identified three possible situations for you, and below you’ll find instructions for each case:</p>
<h3>4.1 Customer previously using the tagDiv Composer Page Builder</h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>[Action required] Manually Activate/Update tagDiv Composer page builder</em></span></p>
<p>Did you use the tagDiv Composer page builder plugin to create your website? Up until now, in the Newspaper Theme and Newsmag Theme, the plugins were automatically updated. According to the new Envato WordPress requirements, starting with this version, <span style="color: #000000;">you need to activate the tagDiv Composer page builder manually</span>. If you do not enable the page builder, your website will be affected by the missing code (now moved into the plugin).</p>
<p>Update the page builder plugin as seen below:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7270 size-full" src="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/install-newspaper.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="708" srcset="https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/install-newspaper.jpg 1200w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/install-newspaper-300x177.jpg 300w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/install-newspaper-768x453.jpg 768w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/install-newspaper-1024x604.jpg 1024w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/install-newspaper-696x411.jpg 696w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/install-newspaper-1068x630.jpg 1068w, https://tagdiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/install-newspaper-712x420.jpg 712w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Go to your WordPress admin area &gt;<strong> Newspaper/Newsmag</strong> &gt; Welcome. <strong>Click the “Install/Activate Plugins” button</strong>. All the plugins in the list will be activated, and you are ready to create amazing content.</p>
<p>You can also update the plugins manually from the WordPress admin area &gt; Newspaper/Newsmag &gt; Plugins tab. However, for this update, we highly recommend you use the previously described method.</p>
<h3>4.2 Existing customer previously using the WPBakery Page Builder</h3>
<p>This update will bring a small change in the way you work with Newspaper Theme and Newsmag Theme as you will need to activate the tagDiv Composer plugin and keep it enabled.</p>
<p>Go to your WordPress admin area &gt; <strong>Newspaper/Newsmag</strong>&gt; Plugins and click the tagDiv Composer “Install/Activate” button.</p>
<h3>4.3 I’m a new client</h3>
<p>Install the <a href="https://tagdiv.com/how-to-install-newspaper-theme/">Newspaper Theme</a> or <a href="https://forum.tagdiv.com/newsmag-install-via-wordpress/">Newsmag Theme</a>, and go to your WordPress admin area &gt; Newspaper/Newsmag &gt; Welcome. Click the “Install/Activate Plugins” button just as described above. All the plugins in the list will be installed and activated. Once this process is completed, you are ready to use your Newspaper theme or Newsmag Theme.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve tested these changes over and over to make sure everything works smoothly for you when updating. Still, if you are facing issues while updating, don’t worry. We are here to help you. Open a new topic on the <a href="https://forum.tagdiv.com">Customer Support forum</a> and we’ll be happy to assist you. We’re doing our best to reply with a solution within 24 hours, however, in the period with a high volume of requests, it may take up to 48 hours to address your issue.</p>

There\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re bouncing between the idea of choosing an entire team to coordinate your new website or app development over a freelancer. Do you need a larger perspective vs. a narrow one?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A software company can <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/services\/web-development-wordpress-services\/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=td_shop&amp;utm_content=freesoft\">identify exactly the client\u2019s needs<\/a>, as it has a broader perspective over a project; a team will always come up with more ideas and can deliver a large number of tasks simultaneously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"freelancevssoftware1\">Now, let\u2019s see the <strong>differences between a software development company and a freelancer<\/strong>, besides the most obvious: a team vs one member.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-helping-businesses-to-achieve-their-goals\">Helping Businesses to Achieve their Goals<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"freelancevssoftware2\">The purpose of either a software development company or a freelancer is to <strong>help businesses<\/strong> (or individuals) achieve their goals and get the most out of their websites\/web solutions. Now, the difference between a freelancer and an entire software development company is quite straightforward. A team vs. a member. Employees that have expertise in several specializations or someone specialized in a particular field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Software Development Company<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A software development team can <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/services\/web-development-wordpress-services\/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=td_shop&amp;utm_content=freesoft\">build from the ground up an entire website<\/a>, mobile development, app development, web design solutions, or implement whatever you have in mind in tech terms. There are also many companies around the world, each with its own strengths and pain points. The projects handled by such businesses are service-based or item-based.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a software development company starts working on a project, there\u2019s an entire process. Here\u2019s a quick overview:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The team analyzes your requirements.<\/li><li>Technically structure the project and outline the design ideas.<\/li><li>Recommends solutions and best courses of action to help you reach your goals.<\/li><li>Establish the project path, document, and timeline of the project.<\/li><li>Develop the solutions.<\/li><li>Test and adjust the solutions (including fixing bugs).<\/li><li>Deploy the solution.<\/li><li>Project maintenance. The team continues the development of complex solutions.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/company-software-development.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/company-software-development.jpg\" alt=\"Software Company Offices\" class=\"wp-image-17786\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/company-software-development.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/company-software-development-300x165.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/company-software-development-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/company-software-development-768x422.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/company-software-development-696x383.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/company-software-development-1068x587.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"freelancevssoftware3\">Departments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before going in-depth, you should know that in a software company, there is usually more than one department that helps the project transition :<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Web development<\/strong> &#8211; a team of backend programmers that connects the coding lines and builds strong algorithms.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Web design<\/strong> &#8211; a team of experienced frontend web designers entitled to create exquisite user interfaces that combine best user experience practices with amazing visuals.<\/li><li><strong>Project management <\/strong>&#8211; designated team to manage a whole project. Usually, there\u2019s a project manager that is in charge of coordinating the flow. Moreover, there can also be a product owner, team lead, technical lead, release manager, and so on.<\/li><li><strong>QA\/Testing<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Legal <\/strong>&#8211; department responsible for creating agreements&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Marketing and PR<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>HR and administrative&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"freelancevssoftware4\">Usually, for a <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/professional-software-company-web-development-and-web-design-custom-solutions\/\">web development project<\/a> you need a team of developers and a project manager to coordinate the entire process. However, there are times when the web design team needs to step in. Or, perhaps, you need some SEO or marketing valuable advice customized for your site. This means you work closely with highly specialized people with different expertise in the same team.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Benefits<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you hire an entire software development company, you get more benefits. You do not have to outsource your project to another different company or hire ten freelancers to do different things for you. Instead, you have an entire company divided into professional and skilled teams that can make things happen on your site. Agreements, invoices, everything is handled between the companies. Moreover:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The <strong>time frame<\/strong> is more likely to be respected &#8211; the company can always bring more software engineers to work on a project.<\/li><li><strong>Expertise <\/strong>&#8211; high level for providing professional services<\/li><li><strong>Well-organized<\/strong> and predictable <strong>project workflow<\/strong>.<\/li><li>Documentation, support, and maintenance.&nbsp;<\/li><li>You have skilled and <strong>well-trained team members<\/strong> for each of the tasks instead of a one-man show.<\/li><li>Seamless <strong>communication <\/strong>and project management.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"freelancevssoftware5\">You can search for a software development company on Google, and you can also see if it\u2019s listed on the business platforms (Clutch, for example) that inspire trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How much does it cost to hire a software development company?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/submit-a-request\/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=td_shop&amp;utm_content=freesoft\">software development company<\/a> has its own pricing, and this depends on how complex the project is and the needed technology. The <strong>most often pricing mode<\/strong>l is per hour. However, some payments can be made per the whole project, trimester, annually, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Software development companies are of many types. Work with the one that can <strong>provide solutions based on your specific demands.<\/strong> However, if you do not have a WordPress development team in-house, you can always outsource your project. This means there\u2019s a win-win situation for both companies and the client.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/freelancing-developers-at-home.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/freelancing-developers-at-home.jpg\" alt=\"Freelancing Developer Remote Work\" class=\"wp-image-17788\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/freelancing-developers-at-home.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/freelancing-developers-at-home-300x165.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/freelancing-developers-at-home-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/freelancing-developers-at-home-768x422.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/freelancing-developers-at-home-696x383.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/freelancing-developers-at-home-1068x587.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"freelancevssoftware6\">What\u2019s a Freelancer?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"freelancevssoftware7\">A person that works on his own, without being employed at a company. As described by the Cambridge dictionary and highlighted on Investopedia, \u201ca freelancer is an individual who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/f\/freelancer.asp\">earns money on a per-job<\/a> or per-task basis, usually for short-term work. A freelancer is not an employee of a firm and may therefore be at liberty to complete different jobs concurrently by various individuals or firms unless contractually committed to work exclusively until a particular project is completed.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Necessary skills<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A freelancer might be a skilled person who has previously worked in a company and decided to go <strong>independently<\/strong>. Or, it could be someone who has never previously worked in a multi-level institution. However, being a freelancer means working on several projects at the same time. In this job, <strong>time-planning<\/strong> is the key. If time management is lacking and everything is done on the run, the projects might not be professionally performed or delivered in time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"freelancevssoftware8\">On the other hand, there are <strong>expert developers who work as freelancers<\/strong> and know how to handle their time and the project. So, depending on the type of business you have and the job complexity, you should hire a software development company or a freelancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How much does it cost to hire a freelance developer?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"freelancevssoftware9\">Sometimes, the fees of a freelancer are much lower than a company. However, you should bear in mind that there are also income taxes that need to be paid as a freelancer, as well. A freelancer is self-employed so he needs to invest in an office, equipment, certifications, and others. Also, if he\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/support.upwork.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/211062538-Freelancer-Service-Fees\">listed on a freelancing platform<\/a>, for example, Upwork charges 20% off from the first $500 project. On Upwork, you can find Java developers starting from $40 an hour to over $100\/hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Benefits<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul id=\"freelancevssoftware10\"><li>Work from home or from everywhere<\/li><li><strong>Flexible <\/strong>work schedule<\/li><li><strong>Low <\/strong>cost<\/li><li><strong>Time flexibility<\/strong> &#8211; they might work more than 8 hours per day to deliver a project<\/li><li>Best for small and granular projects (or tasks)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Freelancing Disadvantages&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Income uncertainty <\/strong>&#8211; this can destabilize the collaboration between you two.<\/li><li><strong>Job stability <\/strong>&#8211; sometimes there\u2019s an ongoing project and two in standby, or none.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Unreliability <\/strong>&#8211; there are freelancers that leave without delivering the final project. Motives are usually circled around the desire to take on too many projects at once.&nbsp;<\/li><li>A freelancer is specialized either in development, design, marketing, or other. Development also means JavaScript, Python, and other coding languages. One developer that knows JavaScript might not be an expert in another programming platform.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note that there are also experienced and appreciated freelancers that work hard and deliver amazing projects. However, it might be difficult to find them and build a trusting business relationship. If you still want to hire a freelancer, you should definitely consider checking out the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/best\/best-freelance-websites\">best freelance websites<\/a>.

Make a <strong>list with all the specifications <\/strong>and your <strong>budget<\/strong>. Research similar projects and ask both freelancers and software companies for a budget, workflow, and timeframe estimation.

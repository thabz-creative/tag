We started <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/newspaper\/\">working on this version<\/a> with a single idea: we needed to give you the tools to optimize every small detail of your site and help you meet all the Core Web Vitals ranking factors. So we\u2019ve taken a closer look at our websites &amp; demos and at over 1,000 websites built by you. We have tested them across all the performance ranking tools.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Starting with Newspaper 10.4 update, we\u2019ve analyzed and changed parts of the code to make the theme even faster and lightweight.<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The results showed that there are two ways to improve the theme and help you get top performance. First, you need a tool that can analyze each website for improvements, then you need a simple way to make the pages lighter. So, in the Newspaper 10.4 update we are delighted to introduce to you the tagDiv CSS Analyzer Tool. This new tool is an essential function that helps you get rid of the unnecessary CSS, automatically generates the critical CSS you\u2019re using on the website\u2019s components and moves the non-critical one at the bottom of the page.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Double this with multiple style code structure adjustment in the Newspaper Theme and the Core Web Vitals test results, and you\u2019ll have all&nbsp; the tools you need to radically change the performance of your website. Furthermore, Newspaper theme 10.4 brings you two new PRO demo designs, you can easily install and tweak on the frontend of your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/page-speed-newspaper-10-4-v3.jpg\" alt=\"Newspaper PRO Demo performance on page speed insights\" class=\"wp-image-15946\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/page-speed-newspaper-10-4-v3.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/page-speed-newspaper-10-4-v3-300x165.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/page-speed-newspaper-10-4-v3-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/page-speed-newspaper-10-4-v3-768x422.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/page-speed-newspaper-10-4-v3-696x383.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/page-speed-newspaper-10-4-v3-1068x587.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-are-core-web-vitals\">What are Core Web Vitals?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon enough, we\u2019ll all know everything about the LCP, FID, CLS acronyms. However, what are these, you\u2019ll ask? You\u2019ve seen on thousands of websites the information that Google is adding new metrics to measure the UX quality on websites. In fact, all the situations <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/web.dev\/learn-web-vitals\/\" target=\"_blank\">reported by the Core Web<\/a> <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/web.dev\/learn-web-vitals\/\" target=\"_blank\">Vitals<\/a> are meant to give you hints about how your site is performing and how you can improve the site\u2019s overall quality so it can rank higher in SERP. LCP comes from Largest Contentful Paint, while FID stands for First Input Delay, and CLS means Cumulative Layout Shift. These three metrics refer to your site\u2019s loading, interactivity, as well as visual stability that go beyond the CMS or theme your website is built upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tools are meant to help everyone understand how web vitals and core web vitals measure the<a href=\"http:\/\/These tools are meant to help everyone understand how web vitals and core web vitals measure the website\u2019s performance and effectiveness.\"> website\u2019s performance and effectiveness<\/a>. The Google web dev team advises that \u201cchanges to these metrics will have a<a href=\"https:\/\/web.dev\/vitals\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> wide-reaching impact<\/a>; as such, developers should expect the definitions and thresholds of the Core Web Vitals to be stable, and updates to have prior notice and a predictable, annual cadence.\u201d In order to meet all the Core Web Vitals criteria, you have to take a few steps that go beyond the theme you\u2019re using or the CMS your site is built upon. For example, the WP Upgrader has explained each of the three Core Web Vitals that refer to<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wpupgrader.com\/wordpress\/core-web-vitals-a-very-important-google-update-in-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\"> how well optimized your server is,<\/a> amount of CSS and Javascript, resource loading time, including the amount of random image and ads dimensions, web fonts, or dynamic content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/gmetrix-performance-newspaper-theme-10-4.jpg\" alt=\"Gmetrix Performance Newspaper Theme\" class=\"wp-image-15952\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/gmetrix-performance-newspaper-theme-10-4.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/gmetrix-performance-newspaper-theme-10-4-300x165.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/gmetrix-performance-newspaper-theme-10-4-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/gmetrix-performance-newspaper-theme-10-4-768x422.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/gmetrix-performance-newspaper-theme-10-4-696x383.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/gmetrix-performance-newspaper-theme-10-4-1068x587.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-newspaper-theme-for-google-core-web-vitals\">Newspaper Theme for Google Core Web Vitals&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s no news here that every web owner wants to create the most appealing and seamless experience for their users. Everybody wants their websites to be among the top 10 on Google Search Result page. Starting with Newspaper 10.4 update, we\u2019ve analyzed and changed parts of the code to make the theme even faster and lightweight. For example, we\u2019ve moved the style on most of the tagDiv Cloud Library elements and templates to make sure that the imported elements have the minimum of the CSS code required for running the components.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that to start your online journey means to have the right tools right to begin with. However, if you\u2019re already running a website, you should constantly tweak it and keep it up to date. We&#8217;ve made a general theme revision for Core Web Vitals to <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/seo-mistakes-to-avoid-search-engine-optimization-guide-to-streamline-your-efforts\/\">improve your website\u2019s performance<\/a>, accessibility, and SEO efforts. We know that there will be cases when you&#8217;ll need to make more revisions to acquire better results and achieve your goals. These revisions go beyond the theme. We\u2019ve tested the Newspaper PRO demo on Google Page Speed Insights and GTMetrics, and we have scores that range from 96 to 98 out of 100. Even if they all analyze the page\u2019s content and provide tips to improve the UX, the results are quite different because they use distinct metrics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"950\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/analyze-css-button-newspaper-theme-10-4.jpg\" alt=\"tagDiv Analyzer CSS tool\" class=\"wp-image-15948\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/analyze-css-button-newspaper-theme-10-4.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/analyze-css-button-newspaper-theme-10-4-300x238.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/analyze-css-button-newspaper-theme-10-4-1024x811.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/analyze-css-button-newspaper-theme-10-4-768x608.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/analyze-css-button-newspaper-theme-10-4-696x551.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/analyze-css-button-newspaper-theme-10-4-1068x846.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-tagdiv-css-analyzer-tool\">tagDiv CSS Analyzer Tool<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve built a complex tool, for now, in beta version to give you all the means to get significant results. The tagDiv CSS Analyzer Tool works in stages to help you improve the website\u2019s page speed and gain better performance. This tool analyzes, optimizes, and removes all the unused CSS from the page. In the first stage, the tagDiv CSS Analyzer Tool removes all the unused CSS from a page, then, from the final clean CSS, it generates the Critical CSS and automatically moves the non-critical one to the bottom of the page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube alignwide wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Increase your WordPress Website&#039;s Page Speed with tagDiv CSS Analyzer\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tnkVapqhIHc?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-how-the-tagdiv-css-analyzer-tool-works\">How the tagDiv CSS Analyzer tool works?\u00a0<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This custom tool performs an automatic test to find missing CSS rules applied by user interaction. Moreover, you can manually interact with a chosen section\/component from the page while the tool records all the involved CSS. It will generate the final CSS file for this page and also will split the rules in Critical CSS to be loaded in the website\u2019s header.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To show you how the tagDiv CSS Analyzer works, we ran a few page speed tests on the Newspaper Default PRO demo homepage.

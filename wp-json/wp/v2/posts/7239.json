If that&#8217;s the case, it might be a little bit uncomfortable to accustom Cloudways Platform. It\u2019s not a traditional one but gives you some flexible tools to get started and monitor your website\u2019s server performance.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-15982 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Cloudways-Server-Applpication.jpg\" alt=\"Cloudways Hosting - management\" width=\"1200\" height=\"379\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Cloudways-Server-Applpication.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Cloudways-Server-Applpication-300x95.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Cloudways-Server-Applpication-1024x323.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Cloudways-Server-Applpication-768x243.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Cloudways-Server-Applpication-696x220.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Cloudways-Server-Applpication-1068x337.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With any Cloudways plan, you\u2019ll get free hourly backups. Their admin panel is easy to learn by the new users. When it comes to a management panel, beginners who are not that tech savvy, need to have easy access to their domains\/subdomains, WordPress install, make or restore backups. That\u2019s why, some people may say that managed hosting <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/kinsta-hosting-review\/\">dashboards<\/a> are better than using the popular cPanel.<\/p>\n<h2>Managed Hosting for WordPress websites<\/h2>\n<p>The Cloudways team included a full plan for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudways.com\/en\/wordpress-cloud-hosting.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">managed WordPress<\/a> hosting services.

We would like to record our position about the Key Activation Issue. Our stand is: we have got this wrong and we are deeply sorry.<\/p>\n<p>When we implemented the DRM in the Newspaper theme, we tried to provide you with a more secure website environment. We express our most profound and humble apologies.<\/p>\n<p>From the utmost care for our customers, accidentally, we&#8217;ve created an incident that affected a few dozens of our users&#8217; websites. We&#8217;ve implemented this automated system that validates the product key in the Envato API as a measure to prevent piracy.<\/p>\n<p>This piracy affects the quality of care we can provide for you, and the website owners with their websites exposed by nulled versions. We gladly respond to all our users&#8217; concerns and assist you. For us, our customers&#8217; needs play the most crucial role in our company&#8217;s values.<\/p>\n<p>The number of requests sent by the automated system quickly hit the Request Rate Limit of the Envato API. In the absence of a positive validation response, the system blocked the website. We know that no technical explanations can ease the frustration, as we feel the same way. We understand that you&#8217;ve worked hard for your project just like we have for ours, and this should not have happened.<\/p>\n<p>This was a big mistake on our part, and we&#8217;re sorry for it. Apologizing isn&#8217;t enough. We have been working for the last days to make sure your website will never be locked again. We will thoroughly investigate how this happened to prevent this type of mistake from happening again.<\/p>\n<p>We take it extremely seriously as we understand the disruption caused in your services. We have taken down the DRM automated system, deleted the image, and <strong>released an updated version &#8211; Newspaper 11.3.2. &#8211; to fix and prevent this issue in the future<\/strong>. The update is already available for you.<\/p>\n<p>We agree with all the criticism that this has generated \u2013 we have got this wrong, and we agree that, even if unintentional, this incident should not have happened. We appreciate the support of those who have seen that the implementation was not intended to cause offense or harm.<\/p>\n<p>Our support team is available on all support channels to help you overcome this incident. You can reach us via email at <strong>contact@tagdiv.com<\/strong>, or with a new thread on <strong>forum.tagdiv.com<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>tagDiv is truly committed to providing a trustworthy, safe, and easy-to-use environment for the website owners in this effervescent and dynamic online environment. Our primary focus has always been you, our customers. We&#8217;ve created solutions for connecting people with technology, solutions for the people to create and manage their websites easily, always placing people and their needs before everything, even our product.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll continue to create useful features that help you succeed with your website project. Now, more than ever, this incident taught us the need to be more than careful with our releases, and be there for you when you need us.

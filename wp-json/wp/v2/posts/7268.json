The change we\u2019re working on for months is ready. The tagDiv themes are updated to meet the new Envato WP Requirements. It\u2019s an exciting moment as we dove into the core of themes and redesign them to open new possibilities for future implementations. Read below to see the tagDiv themes changes and how they affect you.<\/p>\n<p>They say \u201cit\u2019s only after you\u2019ve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.\u201d Well, the new quality standards of the Envato Market forced us to stop what we were doing and rethink the way Newspaper and Newsmag Theme work.<\/p>\n<h2>Why we are updating the core of the themes<\/h2>\n<p>In summary, the Envato market <a href=\"https:\/\/help.author.envato.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360000472383-WordPress-Theme-Requirements\">required<\/a> us &#8211; the theme and plugin authors &#8211; to restructure the products to provide only WordPress basic functionality by May 31, 2019. Just like the other authors that have products created a few years ago, we faced two significant challenges.<\/p>\n<p>First, we had to make the themes compliant and still provide our customers with all the tools they need to build amazing websites. Our products have hundreds of features, blocks, sorting options, custom widgets, and a myriad of custom settings.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, we have over 90,000 clients that love our products. All the changes had to be implemented without disrupting the customer experience and their websites.<\/p>\n<h2>So, what\u2019s going to change?<\/h2>\n<p>As the first step to a lighter template, we\u2019ve decided the best course of action for a smooth transition is to move all the functionality previously part of the theme into the tagDiv Composer page builder. What happens when you are updating your<strong> Newspaper Theme to version 9.7.3 and Newsmag Theme to version 4.9<\/strong>? The entire code that brings you the features that you love, other than basic WordPress functionality, will be moved in the page builder.<\/p>\n<p>The tagDiv Composer page builder now includes all the functionality. As a result, your website maintains its design and flexibility you are used to. The change will be a different code structure.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap dropcap3\" style=\"background-color: #ff0000; color: #ff7979; font-family: roboto; font-size: 85px; margin: 27px 9px 27px 0;\">!<\/span> The new code structure may interfere with your child theme customizations. If you\u2019ve made changes only in the functions.php and style.css files, your modifications are safe.<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> In case you\u2019ve altered other files, before updating your theme, please create a test environment and check out the changes there, not on your live website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t use a Child Theme, read the update instructions below:<\/p>\n<h2>What do you need to do?<\/h2>\n<p>To get all the benefits of your theme, you first need to update it. We\u2019ve included a new section in the Welcome screen to facilitate the plugins&#8217; install and\/or upgrade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 1.<\/strong> Backup your website<br \/>\n<strong>Step 2.<\/strong> Update your theme &#8211; How to <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/update-newspaper-theme\/\">update the Newspaper Theme <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.tagdiv.com\/newsmag-how-to-update-the-theme\/\">Newsmag Theme<\/a>.<br \/>\n<strong>Step 3.<\/strong> Activate the theme<br \/>\n<strong>Step 4<\/strong>. We\u2019ve identified three possible situations for you, and below you\u2019ll find instructions for each case:<\/p>\n<h3>4.1 Customer previously using the tagDiv Composer Page Builder<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>[Action required] Manually Activate\/Update tagDiv Composer page builder<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Did you use the tagDiv Composer page builder plugin to create your website? Up until now, in the Newspaper Theme and Newsmag Theme, the plugins were automatically updated. According to the new Envato WordPress requirements, starting with this version, <span style=\"color: #000000;\">you need to activate the tagDiv Composer page builder manually<\/span>. If you do not enable the page builder, your website will be affected by the missing code (now moved into the plugin).<\/p>\n<p>Update the page builder plugin as seen below:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7270 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/install-newspaper.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"708\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/install-newspaper.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/install-newspaper-300x177.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/install-newspaper-768x453.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/install-newspaper-1024x604.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/install-newspaper-696x411.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/install-newspaper-1068x630.jpg 1068w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/install-newspaper-712x420.jpg 712w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Go to your WordPress admin area &gt;<strong> Newspaper\/Newsmag<\/strong> &gt; Welcome. <strong>Click the \u201cInstall\/Activate Plugins\u201d button<\/strong>.

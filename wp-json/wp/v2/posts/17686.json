However, the first secure online payment was made in 1994 when someone bought a Sting music CD from <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NetMarket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NetMarket<\/a>. Amazon was launched by Jeff Bezos in 1995, the Alibaba Group appeared in 1999, and eBay in 2001. Alright, these are historical facts that can be easily found on Wikipedia and other related websites. But, how about things that are not so easy to find?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, I\u2019ll tell you something about human behavior, marketing insights, and the eCommerce industry in general. Regardless of the reason you\u2019re here &#8211; launching an online store or just for extra information, note that the <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/understanding-the-ecommerce-business-in-2021\/\">eCommerce industry <\/a>is a jungle, and the jungle is real life. Things don\u2019t come for granted, and you\u2019ll have to work your way around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-why-do-people-buy-products-or-new-items-what-drives-people-into-buying-new-things\">Why Do People Buy Products or New Items? What Drives People into Buying New things?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We admire everything that looks nice and feels good. We love textures, flavors, colors, and new beginnings. There\u2019s always a motive for buying any product, starting with basic needs such as groceries, cleaning supplies or apparel items. Besides necessity, there are other motives, most of them driven by <strong>emotions and impulses<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, we are all digital enthusiasts and online stores have attractive websites and intuitive mobile applications. We are happy when something we desire is cheaper. Sometimes, we only buy the item because it\u2019s cheap, not because we really need it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When <strong>we make a purchase<\/strong>, we\u2019re actually behaving in a specific way. \u201cMaslow&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hierarchy of needs<\/a> is used to study how humans intrinsically partake in behavioral motivation,\u201d notes Wikipedia. For a full analysis on <strong>Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of needs<\/strong>, you can refer to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verywellmind.com\/what-is-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-4136760\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Very Well Mind<\/a> website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Did You Know That:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The first online shopper was an old lady who bought groceries through television.<\/li><li>The first secure payment and online selling was in 1994.<\/li><li>Top three countries with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ecommerce-nation.com\/the-top-10-e-commerce-markets-you-should-target-in-the-world\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">highest eCommerce sales<\/a> are: China, USA, and the UK.<\/li><li>We can think of online shopping as defined by Maslow&#8217;s in the hierarchy of needs<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/a\/ad\/Expanded_Maslow%27s_Needs.webp\/479px-Expanded_Maslow%27s_Needs.webp.png\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wikipedia<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\"><li>All the businesses are centered around a customer persona profile.

If you\u2019re looking out for new ways to drive more sales to your shop, you must know that decisions are not rational. You can really influence people into buying your products. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we are about to make a choice, if something similar happened to us in another context, we will tend to take the decision based on the feeling we had back then: either positive or negative. \u201cThe decisions we make are influenced by the context in which they take place, and our perceptions of their outcomes are also seen through the same lens,\u201d notes <a href=\"https:\/\/neurosciencenews.com\/brain-decision-making-16971\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Neuroscience News<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great and comprehensive article with real examples is the one conducted by the Invesp team, that explains <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invespcro.com\/blog\/use-emotional-triggers-to-boost-ecommerce-sales-with-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">how emotional triggers can boost eCommerce<\/a> industry and sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Future is bright.

If to start blogging or boosting the speed of your website is a new year resolution, and you took your time to analyze the offer, then this article may help you decide. Three months have already passed, but it&#8217;s never too late for a change. What do you want for your website in 2021? For example, if you want to try out another hosting provider or need a better one, keep on reading. This guide has everything you need to know about web hosting services, from pricing, shared hosting, WordPress hosting to VPS, and dedicated servers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-you-need-to-know-about-web-hosting\">What You Need To Know About Web Hosting<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies that provide space on a server owned or leased for use by clients, as well as providing Internet connectivity, typically in a data center.&#8221; This is what the virtual Wikipedia encyclopedia has to say about <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Web_hosting_service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">web hosting service<\/a>. It is a very technical explanation, but how else would it be? There are so many people that own a website but don&#8217;t even know what exactly it took to see it up and running. Nothing about domains, WordPress, themes, pages, posts, web hosting services, site optimization, and speed. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, people normally don&#8217;t surf the web thinking about what each website uses, what host, on what domain, why it&#8217;s not <em>https <\/em>or that images take too long to load due to their size. Internet users navigate and return to websites that perform faster and deliver accurate and relevant information for them. If a website takes too long to load, it may be due to having too many JavaScript files, a poorly optimized database, caching issues, huge media files, and others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what exactly does web hosting refer to? WP Beginner published an article last year called &#8220;What&#8217;s<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wpbeginner.com\/beginners-guide\/whats-the-difference-between-domain-name-and-web-hosting-explained\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> the Difference between domain name and web hosting<\/a>,&#8221; and they made an analogy between domains &amp; hosts and home &amp; physical addresses. This is a great comparison that can be easily understood by anyone. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, people used personal computers as servers for their websites, because it was the most reliable and secure thing they could do. However, if there were electricity or Internet issues, then the website was also down, not functioning. With technology evolving, web hosting services have rapidly grown in popularity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-web-hosting-providers-store\">What Web Hosting Providers Store?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Web hosting services store all your website&#8217;s files, assets, and databases on their servers. When someone types your domain name into their browsers, the web host responds and delivers the needed data. So, basically, your website and all its content is placed in a rented virtual space. In the background of a website there are programs, plugins, and functionalities that run to support its dynamics and interactivity. All of these files count to the storage quantity that your website will occupy on the servers. This is an essential part when choosing your hosting provider. Depending on the site&#8217;s measures, you can choose the perfect pricing plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-website-management-services\">Website Management Services&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Web hosting providers also offer website management services, including one-click WordPress, Drupal or other CMS installs, regular &amp; automated site backups, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/picks\/the-best-hosted-email-providers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hosted email solutions<\/a>, intuitive user interface, collaboration tools, secure environments, and more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-to-look-for-when-choosing-a-web-hosting\">What to Look For When Choosing a Web Hosting?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From my point of view, the first and most important reason for choosing a provider is their trustworthiness. Then, you need to find out what type of hosting you are looking for: Shared Hosting, Dedicated Server Hosting, Virtual Private Server (VSP) Hosting, or Cloud hosting. Furthermore, you should also consider these characteristics:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Uptime and load time&nbsp;<\/li><li>Bandwidth usage<\/li><li>SSL and Wildcard SSL (also for subdomains) certificates &#8211; only if you haven&#8217;t them already<\/li><li>Cloud, email, WordPress (or other CMS install), VPS, cPanel access, PowerCacher, WildcardSSL<\/li><li>Unlimited SSD storage<\/li><li>Unlimited data transfers<\/li><li>Money-back guarantee<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-these-are-the-10-best-web-hosting-services-for-2021\">These are the 10 Best Web Hosting Services for 2021<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve analyzed the best web hosting services available today, especially to host WordPress websites.

Yes. Pricing will always be a defining aspect when buying any service or product. You always get what you pay for. Cheap Hosting means cheap service &#8211; that&#8217;s why we haven&#8217;t talked about tons of hosting services at low costs. There are so many hosting services out there that we haven&#8217;t even heard of. Let&#8217;s stick to the most popular ones when choosing our web host.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A thing you should be aware of is that hosting companies might use pricing tricks. These are usually pricing packages that are cheap at first, but they get increased after a few months of usage.

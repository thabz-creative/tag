We&#8217;ll find the answer by interviewing Amit Malewar, a professional web designer who built hundreds of sites over the last 12 years.

Also, he is the founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techexplorist.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TechExplorist<\/a> (one of the top 3 science news portals and the only science news site in India), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inceptivemind.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inceptive Mind<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.infophilic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Infophilic<\/a> websites.<\/p>\n<h2>The challenge<\/h2>\n<p>He started in 2010, and by 2015 Amit was already creating websites for his clients. His dream was to be amongst the top developers, to find the best solutions for his customers and to explore new possibilities. So, the idea of the Tech Explorist website started to take shape into a plan. The developer had all the technical skills, but no time to write the code for it. So, he begins to search for &#8220;the best&#8221; theme for WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found Newspaper Theme in top list on Themeforest. First, I checked the launch date of the theme and the last update date. The premium product I was searching for had to be SEO Friendly, and I was interested in having the lazy load feature. At that time, Newspaper was the only theme with this set of features.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7880 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article.jpg\" alt=\"Newspaper Case Study: Article in the Tech Explorist website\" width=\"1200\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article-300x175.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article-768x448.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article-696x406.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article-1068x623.jpg 1068w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Explorist_article-720x420.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The design, flexibility, and general appearance were as important as the Tech Explorist website I was working on are all about technology and innovation news, highlighting the scientific discoveries, inventions, health and groundbreaking researches that shape human living.<\/p>\n<p>I was also searching for a theme that had Custom Ad spaces with easy to customize panel. And of course, fast page load speed. The Newspaper theme undoubtedly met all my expectations, that&#8217;s why I am currently using it on all of my websites&#8221;, recalls Amit about the first encounter with the tagDiv&#8217; theme.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting started<\/h2>\n<p>&#8220;It took me one or two hours to read the documents and complete the installation process. By the way, you guys got the best documentation. I had posted some questions on the forum when I was playing\/trying new things with the theme. The support is awesome, and they quickly helped me understand how some things were working. The best part of the support forum is transparency&#8221;, says the developer.<\/p>\n<h2>Solution on action<\/h2>\n<p>The Indian developer created 28 websites, including three of his own using the Newspaper theme. His is relying on the<a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/mobile-theme-automatic-optimization-for-mobile-newspaper-theme\/\">&nbsp;mobile theme plugin<\/a> as it &#8220;really makes the site faster for mobile users.&#8221; When you&#8217;re web designing for a living, it&#8217;s the little things that make the difference between an enormous project you love to create and some other project. The inbuilt <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/social-network-buttons\/\">sharing buttons<\/a> work way better than any other premium plugins available in the market.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"td_pull_quote td_pull_center\"><p>This theme has a way to stick into the people&#8217;s mind<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What I enjoy most about the<a href=\"https:\/\/themeforest.net\/item\/newspaper\/5489609\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Newspaper theme<\/a> is the design, the feeling it gives you. I work it for almost four years, and I still believe Newspaper brings you a more professional design and feel out-of-the-box as compared to many other popular premium themes. Six of my clients contacted me because they just wanted a design similar to techexplorist.com ?. On my websites, people are asking me things related to Newspaper; some want to know what plugins I am using. And so on. This theme has a way to stick into the people&#8217;s mind,&#8221; says Amit Malewar.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7876 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging.jpg\" alt=\"Newspaper Theme Customer Review: Infophilic Simplifying Blogging website\" width=\"1200\" height=\"665\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging-300x166.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging-768x426.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging-1024x567.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging-696x385.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging-1068x592.jpg 1068w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Infophilic_Simplifying_Blogging-758x420.jpg 758w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For the Newspaper Theme case study, we asked the web developer to share with us his favorite tools. &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics\/\">tagDiv Composer <\/a>and the <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/what-is-the-cloud-library\/\">Cloud Library<\/a>. These plugins make Newspaper Theme more flexible and give me endless design possibilities. The new builder made customization super easy. I can customize any <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/tagdiv-composer-shortcodes-and-elements\/\">element<\/a>\/module or <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/newspaper-theme-customize-the-header-manager\/\">header<\/a> in minutes and create a brand new website in a day or two after completing a discussion and planning with the client&#8221;, explains Amit.<\/p>\n<h2>The results: Significantly increasing in revenue<\/h2>\n<p>Speeding up the development time while making the customers delighted by your work is something that many designers dream of achieving. Is it possible with the Newspaper theme? Amit explains it for us &#8220;As a developer, undoubtedly it helped me increased revenue. I can finish a project faster and create another website as the <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/using-typography-presets-newspaper-theme\/\">cycle of design<\/a> is much shorter.<\/p>\n<p>This theme is the best in terms of customizability and for SEO. It increases the number of page views and visitors on the site because the mobile version is fast. On my website, before using Newspaper, I had 1 &#8211; 2k page views in a day. Now, we have almost 50 &#8211; 80k page views\/day and some of my clients have 150 &#8211; 200K page views per day using Newspaper Theme&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-7892\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Exploristanalytics-1-1.png\" alt=\"Newspaper Theme Case Study: Mobile traffic Analytics of the Tech Explorist\" width=\"1200\" height=\"851\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Exploristanalytics-1-1.png 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Exploristanalytics-1-1-300x213.png 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Exploristanalytics-1-1-768x545.png 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Exploristanalytics-1-1-1024x726.png 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Exploristanalytics-1-1-100x70.png 100w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Exploristanalytics-1-1-696x494.png 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Exploristanalytics-1-1-1068x757.png 1068w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Newspaper_Theme_Case_Study_Tech_Exploristanalytics-1-1-592x420.png 592w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Wrapping up<\/h2>\n<p>In this <a href=\"https:\/\/themeforest.net\/item\/newspaper\/5489609\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Newspaper Theme<\/a> case study, we&#8217;ve brought you the story of the Indian developer Amit Malewar, also Tech Explorist website owner, that registered an incredible traffic growth while using Newspaper on brand new websites.

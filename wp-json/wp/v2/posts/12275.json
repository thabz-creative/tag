Most websites nowadays have a presentation video right underneath their header, greeting you. By doing so, they\u2019re showcasing what their company is all about in a very appealing way. But what if your website consists of reporting and delivering the people a reliable source of information? Each article would need to link to news reports, and what better way to do this than to let the audience see the news report themselves? With <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/whats-new-in-newspaper-theme-10-3-2-update\/\">Newspaper 10.3.2<\/a>, you get access to a couple of new features that can invigorate your news website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Featured Video Article<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To first understand how these new features work, you would need to have at least one recent article with a featured Video. Open a post through the WordPress Gutenberg editor. In the document settings tab on the right side of the screen, you have multiple sections. Look for the <strong>\u201cFeatured Video\u201d<\/strong> one below the Discussion tab. Open it up and type in the YouTube URL as your video source. Now hit <strong>Update <\/strong>or <strong>Publish<\/strong> to save your settings. With a Featured video, the Gutenberg editor will fetch the thumbnail. If you want to replace it, upload your image in the Featured Image section.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re done, open the article. Having a Featured Video for your post will not only enable you to get access to the Sticky Video feature, but also the Video Pop-up one.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><video autoplay loop muted src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Newspaper-theme-update-10-3-2-floating-videos-on-articles.mp4\"><\/video><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sticky Video<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll.jpg\" class=\"td-modal-image\"><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll.jpg\" alt=\"Enable Sticky Video at Scroll\" class=\"wp-image-12286\" width=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll.jpg 1131w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll-300x109.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll-1024x372.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll-768x279.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll-696x253.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/enable-the-sticky-video-at-scroll-1068x388.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1131px) 100vw, 1131px\" \/><figcaption>Switch the Enable Sticky Video at Scroll so the button turns blue exactly like image.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s explore how to turn on the Sticky Video feature for your new video post. Go to your Admin Dashboard and then to <strong>Newspaper &gt; Theme Panel &gt; Post Settings<\/strong>. With this panel open, click on the \u201cVideo Settings\u201d tab and switch on the \u201cEnable Sticky Video at Scroll\u201d button. Save the settings. Great! Now your featured video post can remain sticky for your audience when they play it. How? When a viewer scrolls down the page, after clicking on the Featured Video, it appears on the left or right side of the screen as a smaller version of itself. So, your audience can continue watching the video while reading your article.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be extremely effective in increasing the average time spent on a page or article, which in turn ranks you higher as a more trustworthy website in Google Analytics. Awesome! Now, wait just one second! Before you close this tab, check out the rest of the Sticky Video settings as they can help you decide where exactly the video should remain on the side of the screen while scrolling.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Video Settings<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the width of the sticky video. How big do you want it to show up on people\u2019s screens? The default is set to 450px. However, you can input a different width; just make sure it\u2019s not too small that the viewers can\u2019t tell what\u2019s happening, or too big and it\u2019s taking up too much of the screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Video-Settings-for-Sticky-Video.jpg\" class=\"td-modal-image\"><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Video-Settings-for-Sticky-Video.jpg\" alt=\"Video Settings for Sticky Video\" class=\"wp-image-12290\" width=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Video-Settings-for-Sticky-Video.jpg 853w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Video-Settings-for-Sticky-Video-300x166.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Video-Settings-for-Sticky-Video-768x424.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Video-Settings-for-Sticky-Video-696x384.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px\" \/><figcaption>You can always choose different settings for your Sticky Video. Don&#8217;t forget to Save your Settings!<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Vertical Position refers to where the video is displayed, whether it\u2019s at the bottom or top of your screen. Whichever option you choose, the following setting alters the distance between the bottom or top of the screen to display the video. The default for it is 300px so that it can give a bit of space between the header and the footer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Horizontal Position allows you to choose which side of the screen to showcase it. And Horizontal Distance lets you add space between the margins of each side. These settings all refer to the Sticky Video that lets you continue playing the Featured YouTube Video on posts. However, just above these, you get three different new video settings:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/video-player-settings.jpg\" class=\"td-modal-image\"><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/video-player-settings.jpg\" alt=\"Video Player Settings\" class=\"wp-image-12293\" width=\"300\" height=\"107\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/video-player-settings.jpg 848w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/video-player-settings-300x108.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/video-player-settings-768x275.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/video-player-settings-696x250.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><figcaption>Enable any of the options by clicking on the button. When the switch is blue, the feature is enabled. Save your settings when you&#8217;re done.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Play one Player<\/strong>: if you have multiple videos in the inside of your article, with this option enabled, there will be only one video playing at all times. It\u2019s convenient so that the viewer does not have multiple videos playing at the same time, with audio overlapping one another.<\/li><li><strong>Pause Hidden Player<\/strong>: if an audience member clicks on a video(inside your article) then scrolls down to keep reading the rest of the post, this feature pauses the video when it\u2019s not visible anymore.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Lazy Video on Mobile<\/strong>: by enabling this option, when anyone scrolls through your website on mobile, the website does not load each video embedded in the post. Instead, it brings only the thumbnail. Moreover, if the viewer decides to watch any of the videos, the site loads them when they\u2019re clicked on. This helps reduce the data loaded for mobile devices and improves the site\u2019s overall performance.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Enable any of these options as you want, and then save your settings to see them happening live on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><video autoplay loop muted src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Video-Popup-newspaper-theme-video-features.mp4\"><\/video><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Video Pop-up<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Homepage is an essential part of the website. When first creating it, you would try to tackle it in a way that makes any member of the audience listen and keep on exploring. If you\u2019re new to creating your Homepage, we have a <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/how-to-create-homepages-with-newspaper-theme\/\">helpful tutorial<\/a> about it. However, if you\u2019ve already created and designed your website, then you most likely want to keep the changes you make to a minimum. After spending hours contemplating the layout decisions, you should sit back and hone the aspects of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as you report consequential items of news, you might need to feature a video to relate your gatherings. With Newspaper Theme\u2019s new Video Pop-up, you can let your viewers click on a video thumbnail and have it play straight from the page they\u2019re already on. This can either be a Contact Page, About Page, or your Homepage.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Flex Blocks &amp; Ads<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever someone clicks on a video thumbnail on a page, the video takes the center of the screen, dimming the rest of the content and starts playing. Most importantly, the place underneath the video is suitable for advertising, which is why you can add ads to display while the user sits back and watches what\u2019s on-screen. This is a great way to reach out and make revenue without crowding the page as it only appears when the video \u201cpops up.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the beginning. Open up your Homepage, or any other page for that matter,&nbsp; with the <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/tagdiv-composer-page-builder-basics\/\">tagDiv Composer<\/a>. Now scroll through the page and click on the first Flex Block you find. If you can\u2019t spot one, you can always drag and drop the element from the list. Navigate to the Layout Settings and scroll down until you\u2019re at the <strong>Article Video<\/strong> section. Right beneath it, you have your video pop-up settings. First of all, you need to make sure the box that says \u201cEnable Video Pop-up\u201d is checked. This will make it so a reader can click on a video thumbnail and have it play instantly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block.jpg\" class=\"td-modal-image\"><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block.jpg\" alt=\"How to Enable Video Pop-up\" class=\"wp-image-12298\" width=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block.jpg 1492w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block-300x133.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block-1024x453.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block-768x340.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block-696x308.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/popup-video-settings-for-flex-block-1068x472.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1492px) 100vw, 1492px\" \/><figcaption>Make sure to click the &#8220;Enable Video Pop-up&#8221; box just like in the image. Write your Google AdSense or Affiliation code in the square container.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The video icon size refers to the play button and how small or big you want it to show. Video duration settings let you display how long the video is, if you have the option enabled. The big \u201cVideo pop-up ad\u201d box is essential for advertising. This is where you write your Google Adsense code or your Affiliates code to display horizontally below the playing video. The images displayed should be broad and narrow in height. When you write your code, you can hit Save and check out your new video settings. Click on any video thumbnail to see how it instantly opens up, dimming the rest of the content, and showcases your written ad code underneath. Pretty neat, right?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow the same steps for any Flex block you have on your pages, and you\u2019re good to go!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Enliven your Website with Video Features<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Adopt the new Video Pop-up feature for your Flex Blocks, or enable the Sticky Video for your articles and posts to enrich the viewer\u2019s experience while browsing through your website.

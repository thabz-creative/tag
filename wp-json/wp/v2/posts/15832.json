Moreover, we have at least one account on popular social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, Twitter, and others. We love to get notified about events, learn about fundraising campaigns, discover the latest news around the world, and shop. All companies and businesses now have a social media presence especially as all platforms have their ad systems so you, as a marketer, can focus on creating customer-driven advertisements on social media. And since the word-of-mouth system has moved online, one of the best inbound marketing approaches is to use content tailored to your social media audiences. This article shows you how to get the most out of each of your social media channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-digital-marketing-strategies\">Digital Marketing Strategies&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what\u2019s a digital marketing strategy? It\u2019s a set of&nbsp; actions you plan to implement to reach your&nbsp; business goals. Newsletter campaigns, podcasts, webinars, giveaways, advertising on social media platforms, and quality content &#8211; all these are digital marketing strategies or battle plans in a big strategy. Each of your marketing strategies must have a purpose. Also, the message that reaches out should be addressed to an ideal audience. This means you need to <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/major-steps-to-build-the-buyer-persona-profile-for-your-online-business\/\">outline the buyer persona profiles<\/a> and send the right, relevant messages through all channels, so your readers can identify themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Landing-page-for-social-stats.jpg\" alt=\"Social Media Profile\" class=\"wp-image-15871\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Landing-page-for-social-stats.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Landing-page-for-social-stats-300x165.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Landing-page-for-social-stats-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Landing-page-for-social-stats-768x422.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Landing-page-for-social-stats-696x383.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Landing-page-for-social-stats-1068x587.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hubspot highlights that your digital marketing strategies need to be <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/2372\/the-new-rules-of-marketing.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">genuine, trendy, stable and flexible<\/a>, in order to grow a company these days. \u201cThis dichotomy in business is partially what makes inbound marketing paired with a careful amount of automation so powerful for the growth of companies today.\u201d Social media presence is an important asset for your business\u2019s growth. It represents the way people interact with your brand, and how you communicate with them properly. According to each channel, you can use social media to raise brand awareness, advertise your products, provide quick customer care services, to entertain, inspire, or develop B2B relationships, as they are all part of the inbound marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-inbound-marketing\">What is Inbound Marketing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital marketing includes different types of instruments you use to reach your business goals such as inbound or outbound marketing. The inbound marketing approach refers to all the actions you make to create meaningful and long-lasting relationships with your audience. Through helpful, valuable content and real solutions to their issues, you&#8217;ll reach to your target readers and delight them. When readers are delighted, they tell others about your business\/organization\/company\/brand and the solutions they\u2019ve found &amp; implement with your help. It\u2019s all about delivering an amazing user experience on every social media platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Communication works for those who work at it<\/p><cite><em>John Powell<\/em><\/cite><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unquestionably, your website is the soul of your business\/organization\/company\/brand. Reaching out to your readers via social media (through essential and well-balanced content) is a great way to connect with them outside of your website, and get them back on it. A returning visitor is a happy visitor!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, basically, your inbound marketing efforts help the new potential customers\/visitors\/prospects to learn more about your business, in a natural way. An inbound strategy wants to earn the reader, while an outbound strategy is focused on selling something to him. Inbound marketing approach uses publishing quality content on a business blog, social profiles, forums, YouTube channels, online reviews, and news websites to gain the lead\u2019s attention. While&nbsp; the outbound marketing is the traditional sales focused plan like paid advertisements (on any environment, including social media) that strive to increase revenue no matter what, at any cost.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Relation Between Social Media and Quality Content&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>People want to discover stories about your business that solve their problems. Consider social media as a place where people reunite and find out new, valuable information. When people don\u2019t know, they ask. And you have to answer. Nicely, polite, helpful. Even when you receive negative comments and feedback, you need to hold your horses, smile and explain everything in a positive way. The way people see you responding on social media platforms is dictating the way they interact with your business. By creating engaging content, you invite your readers to resonate and\/or react to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All your inbound marketing efforts will bring your readers closer to you. They\u2019ll always know where to find you and how to do it, when they\u2019re ready to go further. If your company sells a physical product or software, you can publish relevant content, explaining the benefits,&nbsp; presenting essential functionalities and answering the questions. Furthermore, you can create meaningful infographics or video tutorials that contain valuable information, so people can identify your product as the solution they were searching for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about each social media profile as separate websites of your organization. With different types of audiences, and distinct landing pages. Every post or tweet you show on your wall is another idea of your brand. If you have 4 social media accounts, then, you have 4 other voices of your company, besides your website. In an article about the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/2372\/the-new-rules-of-marketing.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new rules in marketing,<\/a> Hubspot notest that \u201cIn today&#8217;s business climate, your audience has the convenience of interacting with your company on their terms.

The way they interact with the content published on Facebook is based on multiple ranking signals about the users\u2019 behaviour.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook has a policy regarding some content categories, including fake videos, misleading health details, misinformation, stolen or offensive content, that will get your page down-ranked. On the other hand, almost every content format is supported by Facebook, so it\u2019s a great place to use all your inbound marketing efforts.

Tweet short stories with images, and retweet interesting information.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter was developed by four former Google Employees and released in 2006. Built upon the Ruby on Rails framework, Twitter was thought to be a SMS based software. Today, there are over 330 million monthly users. You can check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessofapps.com\/data\/twitter-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter statistics<\/a> on the Business of Apps website. Twitter gives you the opportunity to create polls, ask questions, and make your audience curious to know more. This way you\u2019re encouraging your followers to share their thoughts about a matter. If you wrote a great article on your brand\u2019s blog, share it with your Twitter audience. Use a clear, friendly, and short line to describe it.

Instagram is the best social media to publish images that catch the eye of the visitor. You can post content on your profile, upload IGTV videos, reels, publish stories and apply filters, mention collaborators, use tags and relevant hashtags, and so on. Instagram was launched in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, and two years later the platform was bought by Facebook. So, in our opinion, Instagram easily connects brands, people, and influencers through creative and unique media content. Is about telling stories through strong visuals. Make sure to use attractive photos or videos, and choose the right hashtags (you need to mix and match them from time to time). Instagram has over 1 billion monthly active users.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience<\/strong>: Gen Z and millennials&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most popular Instagram account<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/421169\/most-followers-instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cristiano Ronaldo<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Takeaway<\/strong>: According to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/instagram-demographics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hootsuite<\/a>, 90% of the Instagram users follow a business account.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Linkedin-logo.png\" alt=\"LinkedIn Logo\" class=\"wp-image-15853\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Linkedin-logo.png 200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Linkedin-logo-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>LinkedIn<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 2003, LinkedIn is a social network that connects professionals from different businesses. \u201cLinkedIn allows users to further their careers by searching for jobs, finding connections (even at third hand) at a particular company, and receiving recommendations from other users,\u201d notes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/LinkedIn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Britannica<\/a>.

Keep that in mind when you\u2019re submitting information on behalf of your organization. LinkedIn is not the kind of social media where you\u2019ll find memes to laugh at and adorable cat images.

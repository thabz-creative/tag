However, when you want to move forward with your small business, it\u2019s preferable to switch to your own website. Why? Because it will be your private place; it will be the home for all your creations. If you have a passion but do not know where to start, we got you covered! Let&#8217;s show you how to build an eCommerce website in a few steps. Below, we show you a quick outline so you can illustrate your future business and website:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Gather all your skills (including the tech ones) and passions.<\/li><li>Pick a niche to go viral with your new shop website. If you don\u2019t have a preferred one yet, create a list and choose 3 subjects of interest. Then, write down the benefits and pain points for each of them. Note as many as you can; read and compare the points. You\u2019ll know which one is the best for you.<\/li><li>There\u2019s an available market for your industry or have you found the one just for you and you can get the most out of your eStore?<\/li><li>Research your competitors. You can Google the chosen niche. Also, you could check out Reddit, Quora, other related forums, as well as social media groups of interest.<\/li><li>Is it worth it to enter the chosen niche? If your subject is quite popular and there are many competitors, you can focus your attention towards something more specific, perfect for a smaller audience, where you can easily get noticed. Will it be profitable for you? Outline the involved costs.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Test it out.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/make-your-shop-public.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"635\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/make-your-shop-public.jpg\" alt=\"Make your Shop\" class=\"wp-image-17152\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/make-your-shop-public.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/make-your-shop-public-300x159.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/make-your-shop-public-1024x542.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/make-your-shop-public-768x406.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/make-your-shop-public-696x368.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/make-your-shop-public-1068x565.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-start-your-estore\">How to Start Your eStore<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have already chosen your market and audience, it means you have a great plan. Now, let\u2019s get your website started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-1-where-can-you-buy-newspaper\">1. Where Can You Buy Newspaper<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Newspaper WordPress theme is exclusively sold on Envato, Themeforest Market. It costs $59 and it grants you lifetime updates and a period of 6 months of free technical support for the theme. To make the purchase you need to create a ThemeForest account and make sure you\u2019re buying the product from an eligible country.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-2-install-wordpress-and-newspaper-theme\">2. Install WordPress and Newspaper theme<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to test the theme on a localhost or your server is located in your home, you have to <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/download\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">download WordPress<\/a> and install it on a new database. If you already have a hosting provider, you might find WordPress at one-click away. To install the tagDiv template, follow the steps provided in the <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/how-to-install-newspaper-theme\/\">Newspaper theme documentation<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-3-how-to-install-woocommerce\">3. How to Install WooCommerce<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After you have installed the Newspaper theme on your website, installed &amp; activated the required plugins, you have to search the WooCommerce plugin in the WordPress repository. The next step is to install and activate the plugin. Now you can configure your store\u2019s details, including address, industry, product types (physical products, downloads, subscriptions, memberships, bookings, and more). Furthermore, you can set up shipping, taxes, and connect your shop to your business PayPal account or add preferred <a href=\"https:\/\/woocommerce.com\/product-category\/woocommerce-extensions\/payment-gateways\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">payment WooCommerce extensions<\/a>. With WooCommerce installed, you can enable payments via credit cards, cash on delivery, bank transfers, and other methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/prebuilt-shop-websites-to-explore.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/prebuilt-shop-websites-to-explore.jpg\" alt=\"Choose a Prebuilt Shop Website Design\" class=\"wp-image-17143\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/prebuilt-shop-websites-to-explore.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/prebuilt-shop-websites-to-explore-300x165.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/prebuilt-shop-websites-to-explore-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/prebuilt-shop-websites-to-explore-768x422.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/prebuilt-shop-websites-to-explore-696x383.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/prebuilt-shop-websites-to-explore-1068x587.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-4-choose-your-preferred-tagdiv-shop-prebuilt-website\">4. Choose Your Preferred tagDiv Shop Prebuilt Website<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Newspaper comes with 8<a href=\"https:\/\/demo.tagdiv.com\/select_demo\/select_demo_newspaper\/?\"> Shop prebuilt websites<\/a>, that have different subjects and amazing layouts. You can easily import the one of your choice with a single click. You can choose to import a demo with content or without it. Before installing any pre-built website, please make sure to have the tagDiv Shop installed and activated, as this plugin provides the extra WooCommerce functionality, especially created for the Newspaper template. All the Newspaper theme\u2019s shop websites are designed with easy-navigation in mind, no matter how large or small the store is. They are created to handle any type of content or products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Add Your Shopping Items<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to do in your store is to add products. You can quickly add new products or import them in your WordPress database. Now, you can edit your product name, add general information, assign categories, tags, images, and make SEO modifications.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Create Pages, Posts, and Categories&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you launch a new online store on the market, you also need to make sure you have a great homepage design that reflects your whole business. If you have imported a prebuilt shop website, you have the layouts, and you should easily be able to modify them with your own content. Any website should have a well established structure. Now the tags, categories, and product attributes come in handy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/meringue-candy-shop.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/meringue-candy-shop.jpg\" alt=\"Product Pages\" class=\"wp-image-17148\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/meringue-candy-shop.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/meringue-candy-shop-300x165.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/meringue-candy-shop-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/meringue-candy-shop-768x422.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/meringue-candy-shop-696x383.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/meringue-candy-shop-1068x587.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Build and Design New Product Pages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you build an eCommerce website with Newspaper, you&#8217;ll be happy to learn that the theme allows you to create and design as many product pages as you want. With the tagDiv Composer page builder and the tagDiv Cloud Library you can import any layout and transform your product pages into amazing interfaces. Woo Shop Base, Woo Archive, Woo Product, and Woo Search are the categories under which you can find editable templates you can import and customize on the frontend. When you are on a product page or category page, you can hit the Cloud Library tab and select another pre-made template that you can import and customize.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>10. Ensure Security on Your Store<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure safety on your eShop website means to install a plugin and run regular security checks. One recommendation would be to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordfence.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">get the Wordfence plugin<\/a>. You can download it from the WordPress repository as it comes with both free and premium versions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>11. Track Your Store\u2019s Performance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to measure results and see what you need to improve on your website. Create a Google Analytics account and connect it to your eCommerce store. This way, you\u2019ll know exactly which products are performing the best, where the traffic is coming from, and, the utmost important: where your site and products experience issues. The pages and products that need more attention from your side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know all the steps to build an eCommerce website with the Newspaper theme, we\u2019re looking forward to exploring your store websites.

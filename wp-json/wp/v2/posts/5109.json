Do you want to dabble in e-commerce? Are you going to use the site as a blog? Or, maybe, showcase your portfolio of works and creative products. You should know the answer before starting the process and design the website to best serve that purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Newspaper Theme offers a variety of Homepage designs to choose from to begin easily. From the WordPress Admin Dashboard, open the Cloud Templates section and click on the \u201cAdd New\u201d button. You will be greeted with a digital library of our designers\u2019 creations, with over a thousand templates; from Article, Author, and <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/find-whats-new-category-templates\/\">Category Page Templates<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/introducing-new-404-page-templates\/\">404 Page Error ones<\/a>, and everything in between.<\/p>\n<p>Choose the Homepage tab and scroll down to see each design. Click on the one that catches your eye to see a live preview of it, or import it directly to your website. After the import is over, &nbsp;make it a part of your vision! Edit and customize each element to your heart\u2019s desire and create something brand new.<\/p>\n<h2>Make your Custom Homepage<\/h2>\n<p>In your Admin Dashboard, navigate to the Pages section and click on the \u201cAdd New\u201d button. Give the page a title such as Index or Homepage. Save the page. Press the \u201ctagDiv Composer\u201d button to access the front-end editing section.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s make an efficient yet beautiful Homepage. Add a Hero Element by dragging and dropping it onto the blank page. The item has a default appearance and settings, so click on it to open the settings and customize it to perfection! Write a short description of your site\u2019s purpose and draw the readers in through a short Title.<\/p>\n<p><video class=\"td-center td-article-img-border\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" loop=\"loop\" width=\"1200\" height=\"686\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Create-your-own-homepage-with-Newspaper-Theme.mp4\"><\/video><\/p>\n<p>For content-heavy websites, the general advice is to add a Flex Grid and Flex Block to display all of your relevant posts and articles. However, the decision is in your hands.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to interact with your audience further, add a Row with the Team Member Element. This gives you the possibility to showcase everyone contributing to your website, from authors to designers. Include a description for each member to allow the visitors to build an emotional connection with you.<\/p>\n<h2>Creation, design, perfection<\/h2>\n<p>Keep the layout nice and simple. Here\u2019s a tip: create gaps between sections using white space to help your visitors navigate through the page easily. Add relevant information on the homepage such as a small showcase of your products, testimonials from clients, ads to monetize your site, buttons that invite your readers to engage further. The sky is the limit on what you can create!<\/p>\n<p>Each element that you add on the page with the tagDiv Composer can be clicked on to customize even further. Choose font families in accordance with your vision. Color palettes are great to maintain through each page and the entire website.<\/p>\n<p>For example, for a non-profit organization whose goal is to stop deforestation, their site\u2019s color palette could be browns and greens to inspire the idea of trees and nature. Think of a travel beach resort website. They might use blues and yellows to represent the sun and the blue summer sky and help you immerse yourself in the dream vacation they want to portray. So, pick them to serve your goal.<\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"td-extend-video\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/2GKDrpdzfVg\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>Invest your creativity into your Homepage<\/h2>\n<p>If you either build the homepage from the ground up or use one from the Cloud Library and modify it to fit your website\u2019s core, <a href=\"https:\/\/themeforest.net\/item\/newspaper\/5489609\">Newspaper Theme<\/a> brings you countless customization possibilities.

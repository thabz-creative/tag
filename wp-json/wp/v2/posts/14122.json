Newspaper or Newsmag themes give you the possibility of building everything you were always trying to achieve with your website. The Newspaper and Newsmag WordPress themes come with <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/how-to-install-plugins-and-update-plugins\/\">required plugins and optional ones<\/a> included, such as tagDiv Composer, tagDiv Cloud Library, tagDiv Social Counter, tagDiv AMP, Revolution Slider, and more.

In the WordPress &gt; Dashboard, you can see the list of the plugins compatible with the Newspaper Theme, respectively, with the Newsmag theme.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both themes are fully customizable and come with flexible, intuitive features. Sometimes this is not enough, and customers want to extend the themes\u2019 functionality by installing different plugins regardless if they are tested or not with Newspaper or Newsmag. In this article, we\u2019ll take a look into what exactly is the plugin compatibility, the ups and downs, as well as the recommended and tested plugins that work seamlessly with the Newspaper theme and Newsmag theme.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"660\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/developing-a-plugin-is-a-tough-job.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14159\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/developing-a-plugin-is-a-tough-job.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/developing-a-plugin-is-a-tough-job-300x165.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/developing-a-plugin-is-a-tough-job-1024x563.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/developing-a-plugin-is-a-tough-job-768x422.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/developing-a-plugin-is-a-tough-job-696x383.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/developing-a-plugin-is-a-tough-job-1068x587.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-plugin-compatibility-really-means\">What Plugin Compatibility Really Means?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Standalone plugins, similar to the themes, are developed and improved by their authors. Based on their activity and customer feedback, some of them are more often updated. Also, on the market, you could find free and premium plugins to install on your WordPress website. The free plugins that also have a premium version are more likely to be a reliable software addition to your website. \u201cEnsuring plugin compatibility is essential to protect your site and help your plugins work together to bring the best user experience on your site. Compatibility is also important for any plugins you purchase and upload the file to your admin dashboard,\u201d notes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bluehost.com\/track\/tagdiv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bluehost <\/a>in their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bluehost.com\/blog\/how-to-check-if-your-plugins-are-compatible-with-your-site\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">how to check the plugins\u2019 compatibility with your website<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-recommended-and-tested-plugins\">Recommended and Tested Plugins<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we release any update of our Newspaper theme or Newsmag theme on Envato ThemeForest market, our development and support teams are testing the themes with the latest versions of the recommended plugins.

When you\u2019ve worked a lot to write great content, mix and match elements on the frontend to get the wanted results, and after you save the page, something isn\u2019t right. You\u2019ll say that the elements are rearranged and that the tagDiv Composer keeps loading, so you\u2019ll assume that the theme is doing it, while this is all about a plugin conflict that was not tested with our theme. Do you think it\u2019s a singular situation? Not really. This can happen every time you install a new untested plugin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/kinsta.com\/blog\/wordpress-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\">recent Kinsta WordPress statistic<\/a>s, there are over 55,000 plugins in the WordPress directory.

We\u2019ve made a list of the most common sceneries you wouldn\u2019t want to happen to you and your site. Untested plugins can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>cause conflicts with the tagDiv Composer page builder and the tagDiv Cloud Library<\/li><li>crash your website and give multiple errors<\/li><li>grant site access for hackers, if plugins are not constantly updated<\/li><li>the support team behind a WordPress plugin cannot provide support if a theme has not been fully tested with the plugin. In this case, both us or the plugin\u2019s support team cannot assist you with technical issues.<\/li><li>change how a feature works, but in a distinct way than other plugins.<\/li><li>might be developed to work with a different WordPress version.<\/li><li>be poorly-designed or badly coded.<\/li><li>overlap with plugins already installed on your site.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you have untested plugins installed on your Newspaper or Newsmag websites and encounter an issue that is not related to our WordPress themes, we recommend you to use another environment to deactivate all your plugins and install the required plugins. Reactivate other plugins one by one and test your website on the frontend to see when the unusual situation appears.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-if-i-really-need-an-untested-plugin-what-should-i-do\">What If I Really Need an Untested Plugin? What Should I Do?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are cases when you might need to use an untested plugin with tagDiv themes. You could send us an email, and we\u2019ll add it to the list of plugins and test it with the Newspaper or Newsmag themes. This action will take a while, because we receive multiple requests, and choose the ones that are most popular. Meanwhile, you could create a staging WordPress website or a testing copy of the live website, and install the plugin to test it out. If the tested plugin works as expected with our themes, you can move it to the live website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that WordPress plugins give you extra functionality and that you may tend to use multiple ones, even if you do not necessarily need them. The multitude and variety of plugins can also ruin your site\u2019s overall performance, security, reliability, and speed. Some good practices advise you never to exceed 20 plugins installed on your website and use a maximum of five if your website is on cloud or shared hosting. However, there are reputable websites using many more plugins that are all compatible with their database, resources, and HTTPS requests; and still maintain the website\u2019s performance at high standards. This depends on how good you are with technical stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"background-color:#f4f4f4;padding:30px 40px;font-size:12px;margin-bottom:40px;margin-top:20px;letter-spacing:0.2px;\"><b>Disclosure:<\/b> Some of the Bluehost links in this article are affiliate links, which means that when you click on one of them and purchase one of the hosting plans, we may receive a commission.

This industry uses the latest electronic technologies for payments and safety, as well as for marketing purposes. Some of the most popular that involve eCommerce businesses can be:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Online shopping for retail sales direct to consumers via web sites and mobile apps, and conversational commerce via live chat, chatbots, and voice assistants&nbsp;<\/li><li>Online marketplaces for business-to-consumer (B2C) and consumer-to-consumer (C2C) deals<\/li><li>Buying and selling between business-to-business (B2B) companies<\/li><li>Electronic data interchange<\/li><li>Internet marketing usage to gain prospects and convert them to paying customers<\/li><li>Pretail &#8211; a subcategory of eCommerce for launching new products or online services<\/li><li>Online financial exchanges&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-mobile-ecommerce-is-on-the-rise\">Mobile eCommerce is On the Rise&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From kids to grown-ups, everybody loves to swipe up and navigate through websites from their smartphones or other mobile devices.

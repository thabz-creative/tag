In today\u2019s article, we\u2019ll take a look at the A2 Hosting services.<\/p>\n<h2>A little bit of history<\/h2>\n<p>Did you know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.a2hosting.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">A2 Hosting<\/a> previous name was \u201cIniquinet\u201d? Later, in 2003, this company was renamed as A2 Hosting, to be easily recognized by everyone. Where\u2019s the A coming? You\u2019re probably asking. Well, the business is located in Ann Arbor, Michigan &#8211; USA so, A is from the Ann Arbor.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"td-center td-article-img-border alignnone wp-image-6870 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting.jpg\" alt=\"A2 Hosting Geo Location\" width=\"1200\" height=\"718\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting-768x460.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting-1024x613.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting-696x416.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting-1068x639.jpg 1068w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Geo-Location-A2-Hosting-702x420.jpg 702w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It is an independent hosting company with four data centers so you can choose the location as Michigan &#8211; USA, Arizona &#8211; USA, Amsterdam-Europe, or Singapore &#8211; Asia.

All the A2 Hosting plans use the SwiftServer infrastructure. Based on the chosen server location, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.a2hosting.com\/swiftservers-fast-hosting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">SwiftServer<\/a> is a speed optimized platform where servers use free Solid-State Drives &#8211; SSD, CloudFlare Servershield CDN, or LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress.<\/p>\n<h2>A2 Hosting Pricing Plan<\/h2>\n<p>A2 comes with several options for hosting services such as Shared Hosting, Reseller Hosting, VPS hosting, Cloud Hosting, and Dedicated Server Hosting. The pricing ranges from \u20ac3.44 to \u20ac87.49\/month.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"td-center td-article-img-border aligncenter wp-image-6845 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/pricing.jpg\" alt=\"A2 Hosting Services\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/pricing.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/pricing-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/pricing-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/pricing-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/pricing-696x465.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/pricing-1068x713.jpg 1068w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/pricing-629x420.jpg 629w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/>You can choose between a shared or managed WordPress Hosting plan. But now it gets complicated as each of these plans has multiple pricing offers. You should select the one that gives you the best solution to your needs.<\/p>\n<h2>A2 Shared WordPress Hosting<\/h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.a2hosting.com\/wordpress-hosting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Shared WordPress Hosting<\/a> solution comes with three pricing plans. They have a few similarities you might take into consideration while reflecting which one is the best for you. All the three pricing plans give you access to unlimited Raid-10 Storage, Transfer, and Solid State Drive Speed boost within the Complete SSD solution to your files, OS &amp; Database. They also offer a Free SSL certificate via Let\u2019s Encrypt.<\/p>\n<p>The Swift and Turbo plans offer an unlimited number of websites, domains, and subdomains. The Turbo package includes some plugins that increase the site\u2019s speed such as WordPress LiteSpeed Cache.<\/p>\n<h2>A2 Managed WordPress Hosting<\/h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.a2hosting.com\/wordpress-hosting\/managed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Managed WordPress hosting<\/a> also comes with three packages for you: 1-website, 3-sites, and an unlimited number of websites.<\/p>\n<p>So, is shared or Managed WordPress WordPress <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/top-of-the-best-web-hosting-services-to-buy-in-2020\/\" rel=\"noopener\">hosting service right<\/a> for you?<br \/>\nShared hosting is for those of you who are ready to go for a lower cost host solution. This could be a choice if your website is new-entry, with not so much traffic. The Shared hosting package comes with the cPanel control panel, and you can see when some of the resources meet the limit (such as CPU and MEM usage).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"td-center td-article-img-border aligncenter wp-image-6848 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/wp-management.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/wp-management.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/wp-management-300x157.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/wp-management-768x401.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/wp-management-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/wp-management-696x364.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/wp-management-1068x558.jpg 1068w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/wp-management-804x420.jpg 804w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A managed hosting has everything already configured for your WordPress website. It frees you from the maintenance of your sites like the setup, plugins or theme updates. Though it\u2019s a more expensive service, the Managed WordPress hosting has automatic, optimized tools and increased performance. It settles for a low number of sites on the same server and uses a custom designed admin panel, which is better for the user. Also, with this kind of plan you don\u2019t have to worry about updates, caching, HTML, CSS or JS file minification.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s an A2 Turbo Server?<\/h2>\n<p>A2 Hosting is well-known for its statement of having a Turbo Server option that allows pages to load everything up to 20x faster. This kind of server uses a speed boost Apache alternative. The users get more resources while fewer users (websites) share the same server. The main benefits are that they can host unlimited websites, sub-domains, add-ons or parked domains, RAID-10 Storage, Server Rewind Backups, and more.<\/p>\n<p>These Turbo Servers include more caching solutions than the others and can be customized with the A2 Optimized WP plugin which integrates options with the functionality given by third-party plugins to increase your site\u2019s speed and security.<\/p>\n<p>To improve the pages\u2019 performance, the caching solutions store in memory key pieces of the website, instead of loading every page portion each time the site is accessed. This option could be a good choice if your website gets a lot of traffic.<\/p>\n<h2>Who Manages the WordPress Setup in A2?<\/h2>\n<p>By choosing the Managed WordPress Hosting, the A2 team assures they take care of the whole WordPress setup, while your access to the Plesk control panel is granted. Furthermore, as A2 has the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.a2hosting.com\/blog\/wp-cli\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">WP CLI<\/a> installed by default, you can manage your WordPress sites using the command-line tool. This means you can update plugins and configure multiple websites installs, without using a web browser.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"td-center td-article-img-border aligncenter wp-image-6847 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/shared-managed-hosting.jpg\" alt=\"A2 Hosting - control panels\" width=\"1200\" height=\"603\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/shared-managed-hosting.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/shared-managed-hosting-300x151.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/shared-managed-hosting-768x386.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/shared-managed-hosting-1024x515.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/shared-managed-hosting-696x350.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/shared-managed-hosting-1068x537.jpg 1068w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/shared-managed-hosting-836x420.jpg 836w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>One more step: Finding the right WP theme<\/h2>\n<p>By now, I\u2019m sure you already have a powerful theme in your mind to help you make a great online presence.

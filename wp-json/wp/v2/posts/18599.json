The Newspaper theme comes with the capability to create awesome pop-ups without installing new, paid plugins. The Modal Popup element gives you the power to control all the functionality. The shortcode helps you to highlight an important piece of information or content. With a modal popup, you can create:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Pop-up ads<\/li><li>Fly-out menus<\/li><li>Sale campaigns and discounts<\/li><li>Free downloads (ebooks, software, videos &amp; more)<\/li><li>Warnings and alerts<\/li><li>Several Form Types (newsletter, login, or signup)<\/li><li>Multi-step processes to complete wizards or install something<\/li><li>Announcements and events<\/li><li>Online courses and services<\/li><li>And many more.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For the user experience, the <strong>Modal Popup shortcode<\/strong> is a beautiful way to interact with your website and it is also a<strong> valuable marketing asset<\/strong> for you. The Modal Popup shortcode appears on the site until the user clicks on the \u201c<strong>x<\/strong>\u201d button. You can set it to reappear after several hours or when the page is refreshed. Moreover, this type of pop window can appear while scrolling, and content locks instantly. To unlock it, the audience should <strong>subscribe to become members<\/strong>. Give it a try and see how it works for you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video alignwide td-article-img-border\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><video autoplay loop muted src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Newspaper-11-4-Modal-Popup-1.mp4\"><\/video><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Entirely Customizable New Membership Pre-Built Sites<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>New pre-built website designs are ready for you to try!

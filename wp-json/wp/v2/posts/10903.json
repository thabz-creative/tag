A review blog destined for book or movie lovers all over the world. Moreover, it leaves a lasting impression with its portrait-type flex blocks, its wide layout, and the covers and posters for each of the reviews. With a review system implemented in the articles and posts, the demo is ready to be imported on your website with a single click.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Critic: intro<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea behind the creation of this demo was a review blog. That was how it started. It first needed some realistic book covers and movie posters. Each one designed in Photoshop with immense scrutiny to make everything blend in with the theme. After the images were crafted, a rough layout plan was sketched out. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"717\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Homepage-of-the-Critic-Demo.jpg\" alt=\"Homepage of the Critic Demo\" class=\"wp-image-10916\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Homepage-of-the-Critic-Demo.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Homepage-of-the-Critic-Demo-300x179.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Homepage-of-the-Critic-Demo-1024x612.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Homepage-of-the-Critic-Demo-768x459.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Homepage-of-the-Critic-Demo-696x416.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Homepage-of-the-Critic-Demo-1068x638.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main aspects of the demo had to be the portrait-type elements with plentiful white space between each. Simplicity was the key. All the <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/typography-guide-101-basics-tips-ideas-inspiration\/\">fonts were chosen<\/a> with this in mind: a sans-serif and a serif, Josefin Sans, and Cormorant Garamond, respectively. Cormorant Garamond had been the perfect choice to reflect the appearance of printed books, which often have a serif font for their text. Josefin Sans, however, had been picked in part due to its modern character. A blend of old &amp; new.\u00a0 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each article was based on its already predestined book cover or movie poster. For Book covers, the genres being Horror, Comedy, and Romance, whereas, for film, it was Action, Drama, Fantasy, and Sci-Fi. To faithfully portray each genre, a number of 5 covers, respectively posters, had been designed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Simple &amp; Sweet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Between the various grays used on each page and template, the accent color is a peach pink. It is the <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/color-theory-newspaper-theme\/\">drop of warmth<\/a> necessary to brighten and attract the attention of your viewers. Moreover, to guide the audience along the page, 1px borders have been added to columns and rows &#8211; divide, guide, and emphasize. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each template, in turn, receives these characteristics, wide layout, sticky columns, guiding lines, and a pleasant bit of warmth between the shades of gray. In fact, to go along with the theme behind this demo, as a review blog, the book and movie review posts have a rating from 1 &#8211; 5 stars. This way, when you import the demo and finish writing a review, you can also display the grade given to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full td-article-img-border\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"357\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/A-wide-row-filled-with-posts.jpg\" alt=\"A wide row filled with posts\" class=\"wp-image-10918\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/A-wide-row-filled-with-posts.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/A-wide-row-filled-with-posts-300x89.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/A-wide-row-filled-with-posts-1024x305.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/A-wide-row-filled-with-posts-768x228.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/A-wide-row-filled-with-posts-696x207.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/A-wide-row-filled-with-posts-1068x318.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Critic: installation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To fully enjoy the benefits of this demo, you first need to make sure the Newspaper Theme is up-to-date.

Open the tagDiv Composer on the new Homepage. Now click on the Header zone and the logo. Replace the text with your website\u2019s name and a short tagline. Great! Now click on the small \u201cManager\u201d icon next to the save Icon of your frontend page builder. Change the logo\u2019s text for each section of the Header. Now hit save! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s only one Header Template for <strong>The Critic<\/strong>, so once you change it here, it\u2019s applied site-wide. Now click on the <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/header-main-menu-newspaper-theme\/\">menu element<\/a>. If you have a custom-made menu, you can change it from the dropdown menu of the General Settings. Or, if you want to create a custom menu, then save the settings and go to the Admin Dashboard > Appearance > Menus. Build the new menu by adding page links, categories, and then arranging them in the preferred order. When you\u2019re done, go back to the Homepage. Pick your newly-created menu for the element. Save the settings!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Homepage changes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first row of the Homepage should have 2 Flex Blocks and a Social Icons element. Click on the Social Icons, and add links to your Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, and anything else you may need. Let\u2019s move onto the Flex Blocks. To have them display different posts each, you need to either filter them by category, tag, author or to add an offset. Open the General Settings of the element, and under the Extra section, add a number in the \u201cOffset posts\u201d box. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Show-your-affiliates.jpg\" class=\"td-modal-image\"><div data-amp-lightbox=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-image td-caption-align-left\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Show-your-affiliates.jpg\" alt=\"Show off your affiliates through the Ad Box element\" class=\"wp-image-10923\" width=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Show-your-affiliates.jpg 1489w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Show-your-affiliates-300x140.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Show-your-affiliates-1024x477.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Show-your-affiliates-768x357.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Show-your-affiliates-696x324.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Show-your-affiliates-1068x497.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1489px) 100vw, 1489px\" \/><figcaption> Click to zoom in. <\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The next row contains a text element which can be changed to reflect something else. Add your text to it. Likewise, a wide row follows this with a Flex Block in it. Alter the articles that are being shown by adding a filter or an offset. Next up is an Ad Box element. Write your Google AdSense code in it, or link to your affiliates and upload a dedicated photo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apply these steps for the rest of the page. The same goes for the Newsletter box. Add a Mailchimp, Mailer Lite, or Feedburner code. Great! You\u2019ve arrived at the <a href=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/how-to-create-a-footer-with-newspaper-theme\/\">footer zone<\/a>. You have two footers with your demo import. One that should be for your Author page, however, let\u2019s get to editing. Add social links, Newsletter code, adjust the Copyright code to match your website\u2019s name, and you\u2019re done! Save.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\" style=\"max-width:none;width:1200px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"412\" src=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/The-Critic-Demos-footer.jpg\" alt=\"The footer for The Critic\" class=\"wp-image-10919\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/The-Critic-Demos-footer.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/The-Critic-Demos-footer-300x103.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/The-Critic-Demos-footer-1024x352.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/The-Critic-Demos-footer-768x264.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/The-Critic-Demos-footer-696x239.jpg 696w, https:\/\/tagdiv.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/The-Critic-Demos-footer-1068x367.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Moreover\u2026<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s travel to the Author page.

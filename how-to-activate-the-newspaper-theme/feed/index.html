Hi,

Thank you for the given interest. You can activate the theme in multiple locations. You could use the same purchase key to activate your development copies and also the live version of your theme. Please find more information about the themeâ€™s activation here â€“ https://tagdiv.com/how-to-activate-the-newspaper-theme/. If you want to create totally different sites with distinct content, then only one theme per install is legally allowed. One theme license means one website. When you &lt;a href=&quot;https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;buy a Newspaper theme licens&lt;/a&gt;e, Envato issues you a unique itemâ€™s purchase key that unlocks the most important features of the Newspaper theme, allowing you to access the future updates on the theme and enter the support center. Without it, your theme is locked with no theme updates, support, and you have no access to some of the most powerful features. 

If you have more pre-sale questions or need technical assistance with your theme after the purchase, please send us an email at contact@tagdiv.com. We look forward to helping you. Thank you! 

Have a lovely day :)]]></description>

Thank you for reaching out to us. It seems that the license youâ€™re trying to use is not legit. The purchase code is a unique key that can be activated on a single website. A Newspaper theme license works solely on one website at the same time. We exclusively sell the Newspaper theme on the Envato ThemeForest Market â€“ https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609. When you buy a Newspaper theme license from ThemeForest, Envato issues you a unique itemâ€™s purchase key that unlocks the most important features of the Newspaper theme, allowing you to access the future updates on the theme and enter the support center. Without it, your theme is locked with no theme updates, support, and you have no access to some of the most powerful features. I hope you find the information a useful one. If you have other questions, please let us know via email at contact@tagdiv.com. Thank you for understanding! Have a lovely day :)]]></description>

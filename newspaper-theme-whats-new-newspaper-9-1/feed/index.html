Hi,

Thank you for your interest in our theme! Yes, it is possible to create a similar website with our theme, using the TD Composer. First of all, you should read all of our documentation from here -&gt; https://tagdiv.com/category/documentation/ in order to familiarize yourself with all of the theme functionality and then, try to recreate this layout using the theme.

Al the best! 
Good luck!]]></description>

Hi,

Depends on what elements in the footer you are referring to exactly. These would be the font settings for text in the footer https://www.screencast.com/t/ONAGq5t1Vd If you have more questions you can create a topic in the theme forum or send us an email at contact@tagdiv.com. Specify as many details about what you want to do as possible. Let us know.

Thank you!]]></description>

Hi Pratiek, 
 
If you set up a font value for a desktop device, this value will be applied on the other devices too. You have to manually change the font size on other devices than desktop, accordingly to your vision. Please send us an email at contact@tagdiv.com or open a new topic on forum.tagdiv.com if you need technical assistance. Our blog section is not assigned to the Customer Support Center. Thank you for understanding!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do I have to manually change the font size for every device in the TD composer or the composer will take the value of desktop font size and decrease it accordingly depending on the device?

Suppose, I selected a font size of 40px for a heading for the desktop using TD composer. Will the font size on phone decrease automatically or it is only possible by manually selecting the font for each device?

If this functionality is provided, Please let me know. And if not, I would love to see it in near future.]]></description>

Hi! Thank you for reaching out to us and for the given interest. The Newspaper theme has not been developed to support the RTL version. Also, please note that it is not an easy task to rewrite all the themeâ€™s functionality including the core page builder and required plugins to make it RTL; this means that the theme might be affected and we cannot provide support for this. If you change your mind and want to keep your website for the left to right language, please let us know. If you have more pre-sale questions, please drop us a line at contact@tagdiv.com. We&#039;d love to assist you! Thank you for understanding. Have a lovely day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I&#039;ve seen almost every famous news themes exist, yours was the only theme with huge amount of features that is Lightweight as well,
but we have to buy some other themes that are really heavy with lots of extra plugins just becuase we can&#039;t use your theme,
i&#039;ve seen your 3.1 version was supporting rtl but your latest doesn&#039;t, please consider adding this feature for future updates,
i&#039;m sure there is huge amount of webmasters who want their rtl website to load fast and lightweight and this can&#039;t be achieved without your theme. thanks]]></description>

I am facing the same issue with Christopher and I still cannot figure out why at times the mobile version is presented to the desktop users. 

The other day my client wanted to showcase the new site to a few friends and he was served the mobile version! It is a huge issue. 

I do not mind the rocket loader feature. If I want to change a page (with text editor) using TagDiv or if you want to try to CSS Analyse, you can disable the feature, do your thing and then re-enable it. 

But serving the wrong version is a HUGE issue.]]></description>

I have the same problem when enabling the mobile theme when using Cloudflare. The pages from the mobile theme gets mixed with non-mobile in the cache. Did you manage to get it going? 
Looks like the Newspaper should have an option to have the mobile theme under a separate url/subdomain to be compatible with most caches. Cloudflare do have the option to set a separate subdomain for mobile devices but I can&#039;t find the support in the Newspaper theme for that.]]></description>

Hi,

That would be correct at the moment. Maybe in the future it will be compatible and can be activated without any issues. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Team,

I understand that the Cloudflare Rocket Loader is not compatible with NewsPaper theme. If you could fix the problem then it would be great help for NewsPaper theme users.

The Rocket Loader is increasing the Desktop load speed superbly and very useful for the performance.

I request your developer to consider the fix for the issue. 

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

That Cloudflare APO sounds quite good. Maybe there would be issues with using a dedicated mobile theme instead of the responsive version, perhaps they will address this in the future. You could try the new mobile pages/templates feature, from the latest update.

Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Team,

I&#039;m using Cloudflare CDN which is working really great and imporvement in speed.

Recently I had activated Cloudflare &#039;APO&#039; future which is super fast. I&#039;m using shared server so this future is very useful for me.

Even I don&#039;t need to upgrade my server for higher cost. This 5$ APO futre is giving complete satisfaction.

I have problem with mobile Vs desktop themes.

If I&#039;m using Mobile theme its mixing with dekstop version which means In Desktop its showing with mobile theme instead of desktop version.

In mobile view I&#039;m able to see Mobile theme as well as desktop theme. Its mixed content and looking bad.

I have tried to cleared the Cache multiple times but it didn&#039;t solve the issue.

Hence to resolve the issue I have deactivated the Mobile them to see same theme in both places (Desktop and Mobile) without mixed theme.

Its working fine now but with mobile theme it was lighetening speed but with desktop theme its just fast. I can feel the difference with mobile theme.

I believe its (Cache) compatibility issue with Newspaper theme because I had similar problem with &#039;WP Super Cache&#039; but after clearing the cache it worked fine.

Now I have removed &#039;WP Super Cache&#039; and using Cloudflare APO cache but facing mixed theme issue If I used both themes.

If you could solve the compatibility issue then it would be great help for Newspaper theme users since its massive speed with Cloudflare APO + Newspaper mobile theme.

Thank You

Hi Michelle, 

Thank you for your kind words, and for using our WordPress theme. If you want to create a sticky header menu, you have to open the Website Manager from the tagDiv Composer and enable the main menu sticky. When this option is set to be ON, you can preview all the settings in the tagDiv Composer list. The Transition Effect settings appear under the &quot;Zone Specific Parameters&quot; area. From this area you can make additional modifications, such as: none transition, slide down transition, or opacity. As the Blog area is not assigned to the Customer Support Department, please let us know via email at contact@tagdiv.com if you need any guidance to setting your sticky header. We&#039;re looking forward to helping you. Thank you for understanding! Have a lovely day :)]]></description>

Thanks for the articel. I love your theme.
I preloaded a demo and now I wanted to do a sticky header menu. But I can not find the &quot;transition&quot; thing you are writing about. Where is this?
Thanks.

Anik, thank you for your kind words. Sure, it is possible to acquire the wanted functionality by dividing the row in two columns and adding a menu for each of the columns. If you need any technical help, please open a new topic in the forum or send us an email, as the Blog area is not assigned to the Customer Support Department. Thank you so much for your understanding! Have a lovely day ahead :)]]></description>
